<b>Panel: </b>Charles Max Wood

<b>Guest:</b> Sean Merron

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Sean Merron. Sean is currently in Austin, Texas and is originally from Virginia Beach, Virginia. He is a full-time software engineer, and has been for a little over 15 years now, and runs a podcast called <a href="https://2frugaldudes.com/">2 Frugal Dudes</a>. He first got into programming when he was in high school and went to a trade school for computer networking. This trade school really gave him a leg up with his certifications and led him to his first job where he did tech support for an office. Sean urges new programmers to always have a project and to never be afraid to learn something new.
