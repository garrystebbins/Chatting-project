<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Panel: </b><a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw?lang=en"><span class="s2">Charles Max Wood</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Guest:</b> <a href="http://michaelgarrigan.com"><span class="s2">Michael Garrigan </span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with <a href="http://michaelgarrigan.com"><span class="s5">http://michaelgarrigan.com</span></a></span><span class="s3"> who is one of the podcast’s listeners. He is changing careers midway and has had many exciting careers in the past, such as being a professional chef, carpenter, repairman, and so on. Listen to today’s episode to hear <a href="http://michaelgarrigan.com"><span class="s5">Michael’s</span></a> unique experience with programming and JavaScript. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s6"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">1:18 – Chuck: I started this show but interviewing guests and then opened up to listeners. Michael scheduled an interview and here we go! I find that his experience will be different than mine than others. We will be getting guests on here, but wanted this to be a well-rounded view within the community.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">2:25 – Michael’s background! His experience is a mid-career change. To see the things that are intimidating and exciting. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">3:16 – How did you get into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">3:23 – Michael: How do people talk to machines? What are the different computer languages out there? What do people prefer to use? The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=devchattv-20&amp;linkId=ebc17265e34bf70ada8a866f2588f1a7&amp;language=en_US"><span class="s2">C programming language</span></a>, I saw as the “grandfather” program. That’s the first thing I looked at. Then I was like, “what is going on?” I got a copy of the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=devchattv-20&amp;linkId=ebc17265e34bf70ada8a866f2588f1a7&amp;language=en_US"><span class="s2">K&amp;R book</span></a> and worked through that. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">4:58 – Chuck: I did the C language in college. The Java that I was learning then was less complicated. How did you end up with JavaScript then?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">5:26 – Guest: It was easy and you can just open up a console and it works. You want to see things happen visually when you program is great. It’s a great entry point. We started building things in React and how fun that is. I enjoy <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s2">JavaScript</span></a> in general.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:11 – Chuck: What is your career transition?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:18 – Guest: I have always been a craftsman and building things. I had a portion time I was a professional chef, which is the cold side like sausages and meats and cheeses, etc. I used to do a lot of ice carvings, too. Stopped that and opened a small business and repaired antique furniture for people. Wicker restoration. It was super cool because it was 100+ years old. To see what people did very well was enjoyable. Every few years I wanted to see how something worked, and that’s how I got into it. That was the gateway to something that was scary to something that made programs.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">8:24 – Chuck: I was working in IT and wrote a system that managed updates across multiple servers. There is some automation I can do here, and it grew to something else. What made you switch? Were you were looking for something more lucrative? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:01 – Michael: Main motivation I appreciate the logic behind it. I always build physical items. To build items that are non-physical is kind of different. Using logic to essentially put out a giant instruction sheet is fun.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:52 – Chuck: At what point do you say I want to do a boot camp?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:04 – Michael: I might to this as a career. Hobby level and going to work is definitely different. I could see myself getting up every day and going to meetings and talking about these topics and different issues. Coding day to day.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:51 – Chuck: Who did you talk to who got you started?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:57 – Guest: Things I read online and friends. They said get the basics behind programming. Languages come and go. Be able to learn quickly and learn the basics. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:13 – Chuck: In NY city? It’s pricy to live there. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:33 – Guest: Cost of living is much greater.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:42 – Chuck: What was it like to go to a boot camp?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:50 – Guest answers question. </span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s3">18:11 – Michael: Working on getting a job. I put together a portfolio and just graduated this past week. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">19:38 – Charles: Anything that has been a huge challenge for you?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">19:47 – Not really just one. I’ve done big projects in the past. Seeing that I can do them and sheer amount of work that I have put in. Not really too concerned. Only concern is that mid-30s any bias that is out there. I don’t think that will really affect me.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:25 – Chuck: Yeah, it’s rally not age-bias.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:55 – Michael: “Making your bones” is an expression in culinary school. That means that you put in the hours in the beginning to become a professional at it. So I have had transitioned several times and each time I had to make my bones and put in the time, so I am not looking forward to that for me right now, but...</span></p>
