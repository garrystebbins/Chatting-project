<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Guest:</b> <a href="https://github.com/cmckni3?tab=overview&amp;from=2014-12-01&amp;to=2014-12-31"><span class="s2">Chris McKnight</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with <a href="https://github.com/cmckni3?tab=overview&amp;from=2014-12-01&amp;to=2014-12-31"><span class="s2">Chris McKnight</span></a> who is a software developer who knows Angular, Ruby, Node.js, and iOS. He went to college at Louisiana State University and graduated with a computer science degree from LSU. They talk about Chris’ background, past/current projects, among other things. Check out today’s episode to hear the panel talk about JavaScript, Angular, C and C++, Node, React, and much more! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s5">0:00 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s2">Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:12 – Chuck: Hello! Introduce yourself, please!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:15 – Guest: I am a software engineer outside of Nashville, Tennessee. I work for a medium consultancy company. I know <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s2">JavaScript</span></a>, <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s2">Angular</span></a>, <a href="https://www.nativescript.org"><span class="s2">NativeScript</span></a>, and JS, too. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:41 – Chuck: Cool! Tell us your story and how you got into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:00 – Guest: I was a really big nerd in high school and grew up in Louisiana, USA. There was one other person in the school that knew what I was talking about. I was learning C++ and Visual Studio in 2003. That was really back in the day and Microsoft Foundation class was a thing. I moved onto PHP and started working for a company in Baton Rouge after graduating college. I have a computer science degree with a secondary discipline in mathematics. I graduated from LSU and got a job offer before I graduated. Doing some part-time work for them b/c they were swamped. I was writing PHP and they said that they used jQuery a lot. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">4:47 – Chuck: You got started and you said you used C and C++, why those languages? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">5:05 – Guest: I did a little bit of Java, but it was the “new kid on the block.” I wanted to get into a program that was user-friendlier.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:21 – Chuck: I took C and C++ classes in college. Eventually I did Ruby on Rails. I totally understand why you went that way.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:44 – Guest: I picked-up Rails, because a company (that I worked for at the time) used it. I usually reached for jQuery among other options.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:31 – Chuck: When did you start taking JavaScript seriously?
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:40 – Guest: 2012-2013. Frustrations of not using JavaScript as good as I could. For jQuery you have to call when you have an issue. Then you run into all of these bugs, and...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:18 – Chuck: It sounds like it was more out of necessity. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:30 – Guest: Yep, exactly. Those pain points have been reduced b/c I have been using Type Script and Angular and now version 6 and version 7. You try to call a number method on a string and vice versa, and app development time.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">10:03 – Chuck: ...it has a process running with it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">10:13 – Guest: Catching a lot of those easy mistakes (bugs) and it’s a 5-10 minute fix. It takes a lot of that away. Sometimes you can say: I want to ignore it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Or it doesn’t give you runtime guarantees. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Some other libraries out there have been on the forefront of fixing those problems. REST TYPE is an example of that. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">11:39 – Chuck: When I talk to people about JavaScript a lot of times I get basically that they are saying: I started doing more things in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"><span class="s2">Node</span></a> or React – I fell in love with the language. Your reasons for starting JavaScript are because “I hated running into these problems.” Did you start loving to work in JavaScript? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">12:11 – Guest: I did start loving it but it took a while. I could write a short amount of code and then at the end I get a result. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Another thing that bothers me is FILTER. What does it return? It’s actually <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/es6-articles/blob/master/26%2520-%2520Array.%2520find()%2520and%2520.findIndex().md"><span class="s2">FIND and FIND INDEX</span></a> and you use the pattern of filter and run this expression and give me index zero. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">14:16 – Chuck: What work have you done that you are proud of? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">14:20 – Guest: I started a new job last month; beforehand I worked at a mortgage company. I was proud of the Angular application and applications that I worked on. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">16:55 – Chuck: How did you get into <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s2">Angular?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">17:00 – Guest: Interesting story. October of 2016 – at this time I was all against Angular. However someone came to me and said we have to...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">At the time I wasn’t impressed with the language. I learned about Angular at the time, though, and learned through Egghead. I learned a lot in 2 days, and I got pretty decent at it. I was writing <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s2">Angular</span></a> applications pretty quickly, and it made sense to me. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:53 – Chuck: I am a fan of the CLI b/c that’s what we have in Rails. It’s really nice. What are you working on these days?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">21:13 – Guest: Less on Angular b/c of the new job. I will do Angular on my free time. I work on Angular at nighttime. I build some things in React these past few weeks. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">23:07 – Chuck: Any part of your experience that could help people?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">23:17 – Guest: Learn what’s happening under the hood of libraries such as jQuery. Explore and find resources to help you. Keep learning and keep at it. Tools are so god now – such as <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier"><span class="s2">Prettier</span></a> and <a href="http://www.javascriptlint.com"><span class="s2">Lint</span></a> – they will tell me “you don’t want to do this.” Use the tooling and learn the fundamentals. Also, use <a href="https://babeljs.io"><span class="s2">Babel!</span></a> Those are my tips of advice. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">25:55 – Chuck: That’s solid. Yes, the fundamentals and the poly-fills will fill in the gaps. So now it’s: what do I want to stack on top of this? Once you know the fundamentals. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">26:55 – Guest: Learn what the frameworks and libraries are doing. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Don’t get overwhelmed. That’s my advice. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">28:16 – Chuck: Where can people find you?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">28:24 – Guest: <a href="https://github.com/cmckni3"><span class="s2">GitHub</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cmckni3?lang=en"><span class="s2">Twitter.</span></a> I’ve been working on a website, but not ready, yet. </span></p>
