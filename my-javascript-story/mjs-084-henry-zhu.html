<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/left_pad?lang=en"><span class="s2">Henry Zhu</span></a> who is working full-time on <a href="https://babeljs.io"><span class="s2">Babel!</span></a> They discuss Henry’s background, past/current projects, <a href="https://babeljs.io"><span class="s2">Babel</span></a>, and Henry’s new podcast. Check-out today’s episode to hear more! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5">0:00 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s2">Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:00 – Chuck: Today we are talking with Henry Zhu! You are the maintainer of Babel – and we have had you on the show before. Anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:25 – Henry: I used to work with Adobe and now live in NY. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:44 – Chuck: Episode 321 we talked to you and you released Babel 7. Tell us about Babel, please. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">2:01 – Henry: It’s a translator for programming languages and it’s a compiler. It only translates JavaScript to JavaScript. You would do this because you don’t know what your users’ are using. It’s an accessibility thing as well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3:08 – Chuck: Later, we will dive into this some more. Let’s back-up: how did you get into programming? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3:22 – Henry: I think I was in middle school and I partnered with a friend for science class and we made a flash animation about earthquakes. Both of my parents worked in the field, too. They never really encouraged me to do it, but here I am.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:07 – Chuck: How did you get into Java? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:11 – Henry: I made some games and made a Chinese card game. Then in college I went to a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon"><span class="s6">Hackathons</span></a>. In college I didn’t major into computer science, but I took a bunch of classes for fun. I learned about Bootstrap and did a bunch of things with that. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:12 – Chuck: How did you settle on JavaScript?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:28 – Henry: It was my experience – you don’t have to download anything. You can just open things up in the console and it’s easy to share. I think I like the visual part of it and their UI.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">6;07 – Chuck: At some point you ran across Babel – how did you get into that?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">6:17 – Henry: After college I wanted to do software. I threw out my degree of industrial engineering. I tried to apply to Google and other top companies. I applied to various places and picked something that was local. I met Jonathan Neal and he got me into open source. Through that, I wanted to contribute to Angular, but it was hard for me. Then I found a small issue with a linting error. After that I made 30 commits to Angular. I added a space here and there. JSES is the next thing I got involved with. There is one file for the rule itself and one for the test and another for the docs. I contributed there and it was easy. I am from Georgia and a year in I get an email through Adobe. They asked if I wanted to work through Enhance in Adobe. I moved to NY and started working here. I found JS LINT, and found out about Babel JS LINT. And that’s how I found about Babel. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">9:24 – Chuck: Was Sebastian still running the project at the time?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">9:33 – Henry. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:53 – Chuck: It seems like when I talk with people that you are the LEAD on Babel?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">11:07 – Henry: I guess so, because I am spending the most time on it. I also quit the job to work on it. However, I want people to know that there are other people out there to give you help, too. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">11:45 – Chuck: Sebastian didn’t say: this is the guy that is the lead now. But how did that crystalize?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">12:12 – Henry: I think it happened by accident. I stumbled across it. By people stepping down they stepped down a while ago and others were helping and making changes. It was weird because Sebastian was going to come back.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s hard when you know that the person before had gotten burnt-out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">14:28 – Chuck: What is it like to go fulltime on an open source project and how do you go about it? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">14:34 – Henry: I don’t want to claim that you have to do it my way. Maybe every project is different. Maybe the focus is money. That is a basic issue. If your project is more of a service, then direct it towards that. I feel weird if I made Babel a service. For me it feels like an infrastructure thing I didn’t want to do that. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think people want to do open source fulltime, but there are a lot of things to take into consideration. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:38 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:50 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:53 – Henry.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:55 – Chuck: How do you pay the bills?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">17:00 – Henry: Unlike Kickstarter, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu"><span class="s6">Patreon</span></a> is to help donate money to people who are contributing content. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If you want to donate a lot then we can tweak it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">19:06 – Chuck: Is there something in particular that you’re proud of? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">19:16 – Henry: I worked on JS ES – I was a core team member of that. Going through the process of merging them together was quite interesting. I could write a whole blog post about that. There are a lot of egos and people involved. There are various projects. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Something that I have been thinking about...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">20:53 – Chuck: What are you working on now? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">20:58 – Henry: We released 7 a while ago and 7.1. Not sure what we are going to do next. Trying to figure out what’s important and to figure out what we want to work on. I have been thinking long-term; for example how do we get reviewers, among other things. I can spend a lot of time fixing bugs, but that is just short-term. I want to invest ways to get more people in. There is a lot of initiatives but maybe we can do something new. Maybe pair with local universities. Maybe do a local Meetup? Learning to be okay with not releasing as often. I don’t want to put fires out all day. Trying to prioritize is important.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">23:17 – Chuck. </span></p>
