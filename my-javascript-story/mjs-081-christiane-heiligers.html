<p class="p6"><span class="s1">1:07 – Christiané: Hello!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">1:17 – Chuck: I like hearing people’s stories from our community. Tell us where you come from and who you are?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">1:33 – Christiané: I am from South Africa, and have been in the US for 2 years now. My formal training is in physics. I have been a researcher with lab coats and test tubes. Through immigration, which took 2 years. I couldn’t be still, and started learning code on my own. I enjoyed the art. I had to use Python, and then I was hooked. I enjoyed the functional programming and other things. I had some experience with Ruby on Rails. I enjoy development because its problem solving, methodically approach, and uses your creative side, too. My preference is a Mac, need the Internet and decided to go to camps and take courses. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I snagged a job a week before I graduated!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">4:36 – Chuck: your journey, thus far. You said that you couldn’t be idle – so why code?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">4:53 – Guest: The UK is cold you don’t want to do anything outside! From South American I couldn’t stand the cold. I kept busy indoors – hint the code. You can’t get bored – frontend or backend.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">7:25 – Guest: I am impatient with myself. The home-life you ask yourself: “Am I doing the right thing? Am I going in the right direction?” I wanted to go and pick up some skills.</span></p>
