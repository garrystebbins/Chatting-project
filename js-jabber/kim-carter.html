<h2>My JS Story Kim Carter</h2>
On this week's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood interviews <strong>Kim Carter</strong>. Kim is a software engineer, architect, web developer, entrepreneur, and the founder of BinaryMist Ltd. He recently appeared as a guest in episode 251, and talked about <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-251-infosec-for-web-developers-with-kim-carter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfoSec for Web Developers</a>. Also, he is currently writing a powerbook series and runs InfoSec conferences based in New Zealand. Stay tuned to know more about his journey in programming!
<h2>From Building to Programming</h2>
Kim spent ten years in the building trade. But, it became difficult for his body to meet the work's demand. So, he went back to school and looked for something else to work on.

He graduated in 2001 with a diploma in business. From there he worked first as a tester, and afterwards as a developer. He stayed only for 40 months as developer in the first software company he worked for.
<h2>Moving to Web and Infosec</h2>
Since Kim was not getting paid enough with his previous employment, he went back to building for a couple of years. He saved money from that to go back to programming.

He resumed working as a software engineer for one and a half years. He then moved to Emendo Health as a tester and moved to a development position for almost two years. Kim eventually moved to PayGlobal for two and a half years, and worked for Telogis for 8 months. That was his first four entry to JavaScript.

Coming from a C++ background, it was difficult for him to adjust. He was immersed in a huge sea of JavaScript that was a huge application, and there was nothing so much that could help him.

He started off with good resources like JavaScript, identifying the good and bad paths. He moved to other resources and started pushing the language.
<h2>Challenges in Transition</h2>
The biggest challenge that Kim had in transitioning from C++ to JavaScript was the amount of freedom. He couldn't understand how to change types and mode. Things seemed unbelievably easy but difficult to debug at the same time, because he wasn't used to it.

Not a lot of people thoroughly understand JavaScript. For that, Kim surrounded himself with those who knew the language very well. That's how he started building projects.
