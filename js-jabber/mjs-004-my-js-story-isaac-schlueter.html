<h2>My JS Story Isaac Schlueter</h2>
On today's episode, Charles Max Wood shares <strong>My JS Story Isaac Schlueter</strong>. Isaac is the co-founder and chief executive officer at NPM. Listen to his interesting javascript story, and learn how you can connect with him!
<h2>Programming at an Early Age</h2>
Isaac learned how to program during childhood. His dad ran a small company that had a couple of IBM computers. He enjoyed learning and messing around with it.

When he reached high school, Isaac got interested with physics and math. They used graphing calculators in school. That's when he learned to program his calculator for answers instead of studying.
<h2>Experimenting with Computers</h2>
Starting early in life is easier. For Isaac, he had computers at home to experiment with. He found it counterproductive sometimes.

It somehow meant like he's not supposed to be doing it as a child. He always felt like getting away from something when he tries to make the computer create something new. The programs were extremely limited that time.
<h2>Journey towards Success</h2>
Isaac initially wanted to work on hardware and become an actual engineer. He ended up doing tech support in California. He didn't have enough to go to graduate school or to buy things that can experiment with.

In the early 2000s, he saw the revolution happening in the internet. Isaac got interested and worked for a software company. Eventually, he landed a job at Yahoo! in 2006.
