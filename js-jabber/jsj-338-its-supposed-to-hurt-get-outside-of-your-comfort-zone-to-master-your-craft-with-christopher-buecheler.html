<p class="p2"><span class="s7">0:00 – <a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui?utm_medium=social-paid&amp;utm_source=devchattv&amp;utm_campaign=kendo-ui-awareness-jsjabber"><span class="s9">Advertisement: KENDO UI</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:08 – Aimee: Our guest is Christopher Buecheler – tell us about yourself and what you do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:22 – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cwbuecheler"><span class="s8">Guest:</span></a> I run a site and help mid-career developers. I put out a weekly newsletter, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:01 – Aimee: It says that you are a fan of “getting comfortable being uncomfortable”?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:15 – Guest: I am a self-taught developer, so that means I am scrambling to learn new things all the time. You are often faced with learning new things. When I learned React I was dumped into it. The pain and the difficulty are necessary in order to improve. If you aren’t having that experience then you aren’t learning as much as you could be. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:26 – Aimee: I borrow lessons that I learned from ice-skating to programming. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:49 – Guest: I started running a few years ago for better health. It was exhausting and miserable at the start and wondered why I was doing it. Now I run 5 times a week, and there is always a level of being uncomfortable, but now it’s apart of the run. It’s an interesting comparison to coding. It’s this idea of pushing through. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:01 – Aimee: If you are comfortable you probably aren’t growing that much. In our industry you always have to be learning because things change so much!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:25 – Guest: Yes, exactly. If you are not careful you can miss opportunities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:33 – Panel: You have some ideas about frameworks and libraries – one thing that I am always anxious about is being able to make sense of “what are some new trends that I should pay attention to?” I remember interviewing with someone saying: this mobile thing is just a fad. I remember thinking that she is going to miss this opportunity. I am worried that I am going to be THAT guy. How do you figure out what sort of things you should / shouldn’t pay attention to?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:47 – Guest: It is a super exhausting thing to keep up with – I agree. For me, a lot of what I pay attention to is the technology that has the backing of a multi-million dollar company then that shows that technology isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. The other thing I would look at is how ACTIVE is the community around it? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:15 – Panel: Is there a strategic way to approach this? There is so many different directions that you can grow and push yourself within your career? Do you have any kinds of thoughts/tips on how you want your career to evolve?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:00 – Guest: I am trying to always communicate better to my newsletter audience. Also, a good approach, too, is what are people hiring for? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:06 – Aimee: Again, I would say: focus on learning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:30 – Panel: And I agree with Aimee – “learn it and learn it well!”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:01 – Panel: I want to ask Chris – what is <a href="https://blog.closebrace.com"><span class="s8">CloseBrace?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:17 – Guest: I founded it in November 2016, and started work on it back in 2013. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:20 – Panel: It was filled with a bunch of buzz worthy words/title. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:32 – Guest continues his thoughts/comments on <a href="https://blog.closebrace.com"><span class="s8">CloseBrace.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:54 – Panel: How is the growth going?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:00 – Guest: It is growing very well. I put out a massive, massive tutorial course – I wouldn’t necessarily advice that people do this b/c it can be overwhelming. However, growth this year I have focused on marketing. I haven’t shared numbers or anything but it’s increased 500%, and I am happy about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:05 – Panel: Are you keeping in-house?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:13 – Guest: I think it would be cool to expand, but now it is in-house. I don’t want to borrow Egg Head’s setup. I would love to cover MORE topics, though. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:05 – Panel: You are only one person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:08 – Guest: If I can get the site creating more revenue than I can hire someone to do video editing, etc. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:35 – Panel: I think you are overthinking it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:45 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s7">19:47 – <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"><span class="s9">Advertisement – Sentry.io</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:47 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:30 – Aimee: There are SO many resources out there right now. Where do you think you fit into this landscape? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:44 – The landscape is cluttered, but I feel that I am different b/c of my thoroughness. I don’t always explain line by line, but I do say how and why things work. I think also is my VOICE. Not my radio voice, but the tone and the approach you take with it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:25 – Panel: I was trying to copy folks in the beginning of my career. And at some point I realized that I needed to find my own style. It always came down to the reasons WHY I am different rather than the similarities. Like, Chris, you have these quick hits on CloseBrace, but some people might feel like they don’t have the time to get through ALL of your content, because it’s a lot. For me, that’s what I love about your content. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:46 – Christopher: Yeah, it was intentional. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:36 – Panel: Good for you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:49 – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cwbuecheler"><span class="s8">Guest:</span></a> I am super device agnostic: Android, Mac, PC, etc. I have a lot of people from India that are more Microsoft-base.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:28 – Aimee: I think Egghead is pretty good about this...do you cover testing at all with these things that you are doing? It’s good to do a “Hello World” but most of these sites don’t get into MORE complex pieces. I think that’s where you can get into trouble. It’s nice to have some boiler point testing, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:18 – <i>Guest answers Aimee’s question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:43 – Aimee: We work with a consultancy and I asked them to write tests for the things that we work with. That’s the value of the testing. It’s the code that comes out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:10 – Panel: Can you explain this to me. Why do I need to write tests? It’s always working (my code) so why do I have to write a test?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:39 – Guest: When working with AWS I was writing...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:01 – Aimee: My biggest thing is that I have seen enough that the people don’t value testing are in a very bad place, and the people that value testing are in a good place. It even comes back to the customers, because the code gets so hard that you end up repeatedly releasing bugs. Customers will stop paying their bills if this happens too often for them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:00 – Panel: Aimee / Chris do you have a preferred tool? I have done testing before, but not as much as I should be doing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:25 – Aimee: I like <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s8">JEST</span></a> and <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer"><span class="s8">PUPPETEER.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:58 – Guest: I like <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s8">JEST</span></a>, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:20 – Aimee: Let’s go to PICKS!</span></p>
