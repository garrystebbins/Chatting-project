<h2>JSJ Special Episode: Azure with Jonathan Carter</h2>
On today's episode, Aimee Knight, AJ O'Neal, Cory House, Joe Eames, and Charles Max Wood discuss <strong>Azure with Jonathan Carter</strong>. Jonathan has been working at Microsoft for 10 years. He currently focuses on Node.js and Azure. Tune in to learn how you can use Azure in building applications and services.
<h2>Intro to Microsoft Azure</h2>
Azure is a cloud computing service that you can use to build apps and services. As a cloud service, experience and evaluation are simplified for developers. They have much control and flexibility.

Azure also has an elastic infrastructure. Developers can start small without having to use much resources. This makes it financially beneficial and great for startups.
<h2>On for Productivity</h2>
There are lots of models for the different levels of complexity of apps. With them comes a variety of solutions.
<blockquote>“Because you have that flexibility, you also have some additional complexities.” -Jonathan Carter</blockquote>
Just as Jonathan said, the flexibility that Azure provides may entail additional things to do. Other types of compute try to simplify the experience. The apps service in Azure seeks to help developers become more productive as possible.
<h2>Containers in Cloud</h2>
Containers enable efficiency and agility in cloud computing. They are typically much smaller than VMs, and deploy quicker.

With them, developers can use less resources and pack more in the same infrastructure. Containers provide almost the same virtualization with VMs but in a more efficient way.
