<h2>Gomix with Daniel X Moore</h2>
On today's JavaScript Jabber Show, Aimee Knight, Cory House, and Charles Max Wood discuss <strong>Gomix with Daniel X Moore</strong>. Daniel is a Software Developer at Fog Creek Software, and has been in the industry for 10 years. Their company currently offers an amazingly <a href="https://gomix.com/" target="_blank">convenient way to build apps</a>. Tune in to learn about it!
<h2>An Easy Way to Build Apps</h2>
Originally known as HyperWeb, Gomix is an easy way to build the app or bot you want. It's set to cater to individuals apart from developers. According to Daniel, they saw how a lot of people do programming without really considering themselves as such.

Many just want their apps to work. With Gomix, you don't need to setup to understand systems administration. You can just click an app, remix it, and see it run.
<h2>Node.js and Express as Default</h2>
Gomix presents Node.js and Express as the default environment. It has the long term support version of Node and the latest version of Express.

You can simply start with the default, and access a gallery of apps and categories in their community. Any library will work.
<h2>Faster Startup and Remix</h2>
Remixing instead of starting from scratch could require more work. What Daniel and his colleagues realized is this: most people just want to see small proof that their app works. They then just add their libraries once they see it run.

The current project depends on Express. For this, Gomix makes is easy for everyone to see their app running without getting confused and overwhelmed. Startup time and overall remix are faster with Gomix.
