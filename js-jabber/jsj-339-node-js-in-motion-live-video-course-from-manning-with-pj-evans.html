<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:36 – Chuck: Welcome and our panel consists of Aimee, AJ, myself, and our special guest is PJ Evans. Tell us about yourself and your video course! <a href="https://www.manning.com/livevideo/nodejs-in-motion"><span class="s3"><i>NODE JS in Motion</i></span></a> is the title of the course. Can you tell us more?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">1:29 – PJ: <a href="https://www.manning.com/livevideo/nodejs-in-motion"><span class="s3">It’s a fantastic course.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:25 – Chuck: You built this <a href="https://www.manning.com/livevideo/nodejs-in-motion"><span class="s3">course</span></a> and there is a lot to talk about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:36 – Aimee: Let’s talk about Node and the current state. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:50 – Chuck: Here’s the latest features, but let’s talk about where do you start with this course? How do you get going with Node? What do people need to know with Node?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:20 – Aimee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:24 – <i>PJ talks about Node and his course!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:02 – PJ: The biggest headache with Node is the...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:13 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:19 – PJ: I am sure a lot of the listeners are familiar with callback hell. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:50 – Aimee: Let’s talk about the complexities of module support in Node! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:10 – PJ: It’s a horrible mess.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:17 – Aimee: Maybe not the tech details but let’s talk about WHAT the problem is? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:31 – PJ: You are talking about Proper Native ES6 right? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They are arguing about how to implement it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:11 – PJ: My advice is (if you are a professional) is to stick with the LT6 program. No matter how tensing those new features are! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:46 – Aimee: It could be outdated but they had to come back and say that there were tons of complexities and we have to figure out how to get there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:06 – PJ: They haven’t found an elegant way to do it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:15 – Panel: If it’s a standard why talk about it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Seriously – if this is a standard why not implement THE standard?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:38 – PJ. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:11 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:17 – Aimee: I would love to talk about this, though!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:24 – Chuck: I want to talk about the course, please.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:30 – PJ.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:54 – Chuck: We will keep an eye on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:05 – PJ.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:16 – PJ: How is it on the browser-side?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:33 – Aimee: I don’t want to misspeak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:41 – Chuck: I don’t know how complete the forms are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:49 – Aimee: I don’t want to misspeak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:56 – PJ: I just found the page that I wanted and they are calling it the .MJS or aka the Michael Jackson Script. You can do an import from...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Some people think it’s FINE and others think that it’s a TERRIBLE idea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:42 – Chuck: “It sounds like it’s a real <i>THRILLER!”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:52 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:25 – Panel: When you start calling things the Michael Jackson Solution you know things aren’t well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:44 – Aimee: Just to clarify for users...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:57 – Chuck: I want to point us towards the course: NODE.JS.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Chuck asks two questions. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:34 – PJ: The concepts aren’t changing, but the information is changing incredibly fast. The fundamentals are fairly settled. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:22 – Chuck: What are those things?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:28 – <i>PJ talks about how he structured the course and he talks about the specifics. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:33 – Chuck: Most of my backend stuff is done in Ruby. Aimee and AJ do more Java then I do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:55 – Panel: I think there is something to understanding how different Node is. I think that Node is a very fast moving train. Node has a safe place and that it’s good for people to know about this space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:34 – Aimee: Not everyone learns this way, but for me I like to understand WHY I would want to use Node and not another tool. For me, this talk in the show notes really helped me a lot. That’s the core and the nature of NODE. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:21 – PJ: Yes, absolutely. Understanding the event loop and that’s aimed more towards people from other back ends. Right from the beginning we go over that detail: Here is how it works, we give them examples, and more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:08 – Aimee: You can do more than just create APIs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Aimee mentions </i><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41786986/vanilla-node-vs-express"><span class="s3"><i>Vanilla Node.</i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:50 – PJ: To get into frameworks we do a 3-line server. We cover express, and also <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/sequelize-orm-nodejs-introduction?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoMKk7b7N3gIVArvsCh2-iQpYEAAYASAAEgL1BfD_BwE&amp;ef_id=W@i67QAABdGIR-5m:20181111232741:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!5668!3!277727472944!b!!g!!&amp;aid=701j0000001heIoAAI&amp;promo=&amp;oid=&amp;utm_source=non_branded&amp;utm_medium=digital_paid_search_google&amp;utm_campaign=US_Dynamic&amp;utm_content="><span class="s3">Sequelize ORM.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">19:45 – <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"><span class="s3">Advertisement – Sentry.io</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:43 – Chuck: I never used Pug.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">20:45 – PJ: <a href="https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2184"><span class="s3">PUG used to be called JADE.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:56 – Aimee. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:14 – PJ: Express does that for you and I agree with you. I advocate a non-scripted approach, I like when frameworks have a light touch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:05 – Aimee: That’s what I liked about it. No offense, Chuck, but for me I didn’t like NOT knowing a lot of what was not happening under the hood. I didn’t want to reinvent the wheel, but I wanted to build at a lower level.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:40 – PJ: I had the same experience. I wanted to figure out why something wasn’t working. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:24 – Panel: I had a friend who used Rails...he was cautious to make a switch. This past year he was blown away with how much simpler it was and how fast things were. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:05 – Aimee: I feel like if you want to learn JavaScript then Node might be easier on the frontend. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:21 – Chuck: No pun intended. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">No, but I agree. I like about Rails is that you had well-understood patterns. But the flipside is that you have abstractions...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">To a certain degree: what did I do wrong? And you didn’t follow the pattern properly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:57 – Panel: With Node you get a little bit of both. To me it’s a more simple approach, but the downside is that you have 100’s of 1,000’s of modules that almost identical things. When you start reaching out to NPM that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:29 – PJ: Yes the module system of NPM is the best/worst thing about NODE. I don’t have an answer, honestly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">There is a great article written that made me turn white. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5"><span class="s3">Here is the article!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:12 – Panel: The same thing happened with the <a href="https://eslint.org"><span class="s3">ESLint</span></a>. That was the very problem that he was describing in the article. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:50 – PJ: Yep, I put that in the chat there – go ahead and read it! It’s not a problem that’s specific to Node, there are others. It’s the way we do things now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:23 – Chuck: We have the NODE Security project. A lot of stuff go into NPM everyday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:43 – PJ: We cover those things in the course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:53 – Chuck: It’s the reality. Is there a place that people get stuck?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:00 – PJ answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:23 – Aimee. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:55 – PJ: I am coding very similar to my PHP days. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:20 – Aimee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:02 – PJ: To finish off my point, I hope people don’t loose sight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:18 – Aimee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:20 – PJ: I am working on a project that has thousands of requests for...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:53 – Chuck: Anything you WANTED to put into the course, but didn’t have time to?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:05 – PJ: You can get pretty technical. It’s not an advanced course, and it won’t turn you into a rock star. This is all about confidence building. It’s to understand the fundamentals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">It’s a runtime of 6 hours and 40 minutes – you aren’t just watching a video. You have a transcript, too, running off on the side. You can sit there and type it out w/o leaving – so it’s a very interactive course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:26 – Chuck: You get people over the hump. What do you think people need to know to be successful with Node?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:38 – <i>PJ answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">PJ: I think it’s a lot of practice and the student to go off and be curious on their own terms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:13 – Chuck: You talked about callbacks – I am thinking that one is there to manage the other?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:31 – <i>PJ answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">PJ: You do what works for you – pick your style – do it as long as people can follow you. Take the analogy of building a bridge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:53 – Chuck: What are you working on now? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:00 – PJ: Educational tool called SCHOOL PLANNER launched in Ireland, so teachers can do their lesson planning for the year and being built with Express. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Google Classroom and Google Calendar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:01 <i>– PJ talks about Pi and 4wd. See links below.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:09 – Node can be used all over the place!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:16<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>- Chuck: Yes, the same can be said for other languages. Yes, Node is in the same space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:31 – PJ: Yep! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:33 – Chuck: If people want to find you online where can they find you?</span></p>
