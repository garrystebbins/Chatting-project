<h2>My JS Story Jon Schlinkert</h2>
On today's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood welcomes Jon Schlinkert. Jon was on JavaScript Jabber <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/098-jsj-assemble-io-with-brian-woodward-and-jon-schlinkert" target="_blank">episode 98</a> where he talked about Assemble.io. Tune into <strong>My JS Story Jon Schlinkert</strong> to learn how his journey began in programming and what's keeping him busy these days.
<h2>The Unlikely Start</h2>
In the beginning, he really didn't intend to get into programming. Over five years ago, he was into business management and strategy related things. He often got engaged with something that has to do with programming, but he really never had an inkling of what APIs were.

One day he got to read "Fortunate at the Bottom of the Pyramid", a book which talked about the percentage of impoverished people worldwide. The more he discovered about this global issue, the more he wanted to help out solve the supply chain problem. He developed a platform which was hard to execute, and so he learned to program.
<h2>Stepping Into JavaScript</h2>
Initially, he didn't have any hope of learning how to write code. All he wanted was just to learn how to design and build prototypes. The very first thing he did was to learn HTML and CSS.

Jon ended up joining the JS core team after about a year. His primary contribution was documentation.

He recalls the time he decided to learn about JavaScript. He approached his friend, Brian Woodward, to help him build a tool to generate prototypes. His first JavaScript project was a static site generator now known as <a href="http://assemble.io/" target="_blank">Assemble</a>.
<h2>Contributions to the Community</h2>
Not being into programming for a long time has gotten Jon nervous about the project he created in Github. The main objective was to simply create tools that would help the programming work faster, and provide convenience in building the things they needed. So, they focused on micro-libraries.
<p class="r">These micro-libraries are small self-encapsulated libraries. Over time, these developed and became better. Later on, these projects started to be used by a lot of people worldwide. Now, their tools are being downloaded 650 million times a month.</p>
