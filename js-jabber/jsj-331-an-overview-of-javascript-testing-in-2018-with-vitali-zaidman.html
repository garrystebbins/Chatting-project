<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guests:</b></span><span class="s3"> <a href="https://medium.com/@vzaidman"><span class="s4">Vitali Zaidman</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks with programmer, <a href="https://medium.com/@vzaidman"><span class="s4">Vitali Zaidman</span></a>, who is working with Software Solutions Company. He researches technologies and starts new projects all the time, and looks at these new technologies within the market. The panel talks about testing JavaScript in 2018 and <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:32 – Chuck: Let’s talk about testing JavaScript in 2018. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:53 – <a href="https://medium.com/@vzaidman"><span class="s4">Vitali</span></a> talks about solving problems in JavaScript.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:46 – Chuck asks <a href="https://medium.com/@vzaidman"><span class="s4">Vitali</span></a> a question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:03 – Vitali’s answer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:30 – Why <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a>? Why not Mocha or these other programs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:49 – <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a> is the best interruption of what testing should look like and the best practice nowadays. There are different options, they can be better, but <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a> has this great support from their community. There are great new features. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:31 – Chuck to Joe: What are you using for testing nowadays?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:43 – Joe: I use Angular, primarily.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:01 – Like life, it’s sometimes easier to use things that make things very valuable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:55 – Aimee: I have heard great things about <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/free-and-open-source-software-download-page"><span class="s4">Cypress</span></a>, but at work we are using another program. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:22 – Vitali: Check out my article.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:51 – Aimee: There are too many problems with the program that we use at work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:39 – Panelist to Vitali: I read your article, and I am a fan. Why do you pick Test Café over Cypress, and how familiar are you with Cypress? What about Selenium and other programs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:12 – Vitali: “Test Café and Cypress are competing head-to-head.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Listen to Vitali’s suggestions and comments per the panelists’ question at this timestamp. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:25 – Chuck: I see that you use sign-on...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:29 – Aimee: Can you talk about<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer"><span class="s4"> Puppeteer</span></a>? It seems promising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:45 – Vitali: Yes, Puppeteer is promising. It’s developed by Google and by Chrome. You don’t want to use all of your tests in Puppeteer, because it will be really hard to do in other browsers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:26: Panelist: “...5, 6, 7, years ago it was important of any kind of <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a> testing you had no idea if it worked in one browser and it not necessarily works in another browser. That was 10 years ago. Is multiple browsers testing as important then as it is now?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:51: Vitali answers the above question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:30 – Aimee: If it is more <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a> heavy then it could possibly cause more problems. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:56 – Panelist: I agree with this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:02 – Vitali continues this conversation with additional comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:17 – Aimee: “I see that Safari is the new Internet Explorer.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:23: Chuck: “Yes, you have to know your audience. Are they using older browsers? What is the compatibility?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:01 – Vitali: There are issues with the security. Firefox has a feature of tracking protection; something like that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:33 – Question to Vitali by Panelist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:55 – Vitali answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:30 – Panelist makes additional comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:43 – If you use Safari, you reap what you sow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:49 – Chuck: I use Chrome on my iPhone. (Aimee does, too.) Sometimes I wind up in Safari by accident. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:38 – Panelist makes comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:52 – Vitali tells a funny story that relates to this topic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:45 – There are too many standards out there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:05 – Aimee makes comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:08 – <a href="https://brutalist-web.design"><span class="s4">Brutalist Web Design</span></a>. Some guy has this site – <a href="https://brutalist-web.design"><span class="s4">Brutalist Web Design</span></a> – where he says use basic stuff and stop being so custom. Stop using the web as some crazy platform, and if your site is a website that can be scrolled through, that’s great. It needs to be just enough for people to see your content. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:16 – Aimee makes additional comments about this topic of <a href="https://brutalist-web.design"><span class="s4">Brutalist Web Design</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:35 – Panelist: I like it when people go out and say things like that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:45 – Here is the point, though. There is a difference between a website and a web application. Really the purpose is to read an article. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:37 – Vitali chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:01 – Back to the topic of content on websites. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:17 – Panelist: Medium is very minimal. Medium doesn’t feel like an application. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:10 – Is the website easy enough for the user to scroll through and get the content like they want to? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">26:19 – <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"><span class="s2">Advertisement.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:22 – See how far off the topic we got?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:31 – These are my favorite conversations to have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:39 – Vitali: Let’s talk about how my article got so popular. It’s an interesting thing, I started researching “testing” for my company. We wanted to implement one of the testing tools. Instead of creating a presentation, I would write first about it in Medium to get feedback from the community as well. It was a great decision, because I got a lot of comments back. I enjoyed the experience, too. Just write about your problem in Medium to see what people say.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:48 – Panelist: You put a ton of time and energy in this article. There are tons of links. Did you really go through all of those articles? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:10 – Yes, what are the most permanent tools? I was just reading through a lot of comments and feedback from people. I tested the tools myself, too!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:37 – Panelist: You broke down the article, and it’s a 22-minute read.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:09 – Vitali: I wrote the article for my company, and they ad to read it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:24 – Panelist: Spending so much time – you probably felt like it was apart of your job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:39 – Vitali: I really like creating and writing. It was rally amazing for me and a great experience. I feel like I am talented in this area because I write well and fast. I wanted to express myself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:17 – Did you edit and review? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:23 – Vitali: I wrote it by myself and some friends read it. There were serious mistakes, and that’s okay I am not afraid of mistakes. This way you get feedback.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:10 – Chuck: “Some people see testing in JavaScript, and people look at this and say there are so much here. Is there a place where people can start, so that way they don’t’ get too overwhelmed? Is there a way to ease into this and take a bite-size at a time?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:52 – Vitali: “Find something that works for them. Read the article and start writing code.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">He continues this conversation from here on out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:03 – Chuck continues to ask questions and add other comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:16 – Vitali chimes-in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:38 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:46 – Vitali piggybacks off of Chuck’s comments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:14 – Panelist: Let’s go back to <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a>. There is a very common occurrence where we see lots of turn and we see ideas like this has become the dominant or the standard, a lot of people talk about stuff within this community. Then we get this idea that ‘this is the only thing that is happening.’ Transition to <a href="https://jquery.com"><span class="s4">jQuery</span></a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s4">React</span></a> to... With that context do you feel like <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a> will be a dominant program? Are we going to see <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a> used just as common as Mocha and other popular programs? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:15 – Vitali comments on the panelist’s question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:50 – Panelist: New features. Are the features in <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a> (over Jasmine, Mocha, etc.) so important that it will drive people to it by itself?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:30 – Vitali comments on this great question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:58 – Panelist asks questions about features about <a href="https://jestjs.io"><span class="s4">Jest</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:29 – Vitali talks about this topic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:14 – Let’s go to picks!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">42:14 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s2">Advertisement.</span></a></span></p>
