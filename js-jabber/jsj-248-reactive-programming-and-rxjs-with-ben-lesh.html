<h2>Reactive Programming and RxJS with Ben Lesh</h2>
On today's episode, Charles Max Wood, Joe Eames, and Tracy Lee discuss <strong>Reactive Programming and RxJS with Ben Lesh.</strong> Ben works at Netflix and also has a side job for Rx Workshop with Tracy. He is the lead author of RxJS 5. Tune in to learn more about RxJS!
<h2><strong>What is RxJS and Rx Workshop?</strong></h2>
In contrast to a Promise, RxJS as an Observable can have more than one notification. When people talk about Reactive Programming, basically they're talking about RxJS in the context of JavaScript. RxJS has been adopted by Angular and its latest incarnation.

Ben designed the Rx Workshop to help people think and program reactively. It also teaches them how to use Observables and the operators that are included in RxJS.
<h2><strong>Functional and Reactive Programming</strong></h2>
Functional-reactive programming is a term coined by Conal Elliot. It covers the ideas of time and timing of events. It is slightly different from what you see with RxJS. Many people would call RxJS a functional-reactive programming, pointing out to the same thing.

Functional and reactive programming are both involved in data transformation of that which arrives for your events reactively. Both are also functional. One has more definitions around timing and the white papers or on whatever they were previously written.
<h2><strong>What does RxJS do?</strong></h2>
RxJS has a lot of operators off the Observable type. An Observable is just a function that takes an Observer, which has three different methods.

You can think of it as three different callbacks which are next, air, and complete. These enable you to have an Observable that allows you to treat events by set.
