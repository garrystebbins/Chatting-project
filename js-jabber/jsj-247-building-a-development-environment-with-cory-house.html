<h2><strong>Building a Development Environment with Cory House</strong></h2>
On today's episode, Charles Max Wood, AJ O'neal, Joe Eames, and Aimee Knight discuss <strong>Building a Development Environment with Cory House</strong>. Pluralsight <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cory-house">recently added a course</a> on this. Tune in to know more!
<h2><strong>The Rationale Behind</strong></h2>
The course on Building a Development Environment was created to help developers make their lives easier and to enforce quality in their JavaScript code base. It offers the idea of going through a methodical process so as not to miss important opportunities.

In 2016, a lot of people created their own boiler plates, starter kits, and JavaScript development environment. Everything boils down to the notion that getting started is really overwhelming considering that there are lots of decisions to make. The number of decisions to be made is so significant that it is unrealistic for any professional to absorb.
<h2><strong>Preparing for the Course</strong></h2>
After Cory realized that there were more potential decisions to be made than what he recognized, he took time identifying them out. He went through the previous projects that he had and listed what pieces were in there. He did automated testing, linting, bundling, and minifying the code.

Knowing that the number of decisions is huge, he came up with 40 decisions that he deemed to be key for building a Java Script environment. He said that the best majority would likely agree with what's on the list but would never want to sit down writing a line of code and asking themselves with those questions.
<h2><strong>Designed for Starters</strong></h2>
The course is created to help beginner developers because it covers interesting ways in building a foundation in testing.  It is designed in a way that it would bring awareness that there are options to choose from. Students will be introduced to a variety of ways on how to handle package managers, bundling, or minification.
