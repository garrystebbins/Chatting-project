<h2>My JS Story Alex Russel</h2>
On this week's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood interviews <strong>Alex Russel</strong>. Alex is a software engineer on the Chrome team. He focuses on designing new features and running their standards work. He appeared as a guest on <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/087-jsj-tc39-with-alex-russell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode 87</a>, where he talked about TC39. Tune in to his story!
<h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
Alex had access to a computer as a child. His father was a mechanical engineer who always had a computer. But, it was only when he reached high school that he got interested with it.

He had access to Unix computers which had on a C Shell compiler. He also even had access to Pascal. In the process, he learned HTML from a particular website as well as JavaScript. That gave him a step ahead of his peers.
<h2>Not Too Bad</h2>
Alex did not do well at school. He dropped out of college, and did a couple of security stuffs at the side. His experiences exposed him to JavaScript.

Back then, CSS was still new. He saw the start of a couple of things in programming. Looking back, he remembers the page would reload from scratch every time they resize the browser window.
<h2>Past and Present Days</h2>
The community found each other in the web, and started comparing their works. It was a community of those who made the first generation of libraries.

Now, Alex commends the quality of dev tools and the consistency between implementations. In the past, they had to spend a lot of time just to navigate through things. There were no console tools to begin with.
