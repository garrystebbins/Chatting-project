**React Native Radio | Episode 100\*\*** Panel: **Nader Dabit Peter Piekarczyk Gant LaBorde** Special Guests:**Vladimir Novick In this episode of React Native Radio, the panel talks to Vladimir Novick. Vladimir started with programming as a child and when [React](https://reactjs.org/) came out he jumped into the library.

They talk about the React community in Israel, what IoT is, and how React Native works with IoT. They also touch on his [smarthome-manager](https://github.com/vnovick/smarthome-manager), where people would go to get started with building IoT apps, and more!**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:\*\*
