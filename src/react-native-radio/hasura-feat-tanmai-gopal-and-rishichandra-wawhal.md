Also, what is and give us an elevator pitch, please. 0:57 – Guest. 1:42 – 2<sup>nd</sup> Guest gives his background and talks about the company. 2:12 – Nader: What is the company, Hasura about? What kind of company is it and how did it start? Where is everyone located, too? 2:31 – Guest. 4:00 – Nader: Is this the first company you’ve started? And how did you get into this sort of stuff? 4:10 – Guest. 5:58 – Nader: Graph QL – I’ve heard so much about it. Can you talk about why you chose Graph QL as an implementation of this sort of idea? 6:25 – Guest answers the question. 10:20 – Nader: With Graph QL what are the benefits of using something like Hasura? I would think you wouldn’t want to spend a lot of time by building something from scratch. Can you give me an idea of why someone would want to use Hasura as opposed to building their own API? 10:53 – Guest: It’s exactly what you just said. 14:53 – Nader: Interesting – if you want to work with Hasura on the backend what would you want to use for the client? Something like Apollo or something like...is that right? 15:07 – Guest. 15:38 – Nader: Most of the people are using probably for the client and for real-time? 15:45 – Guest: Exactly. 15:54 – Nader: Why would mobile developers look at Graph QL rather than the traditional rest API? 16:26 – The guest answers the question. 21:01 – Nader: If something is building their next React Native App – what would the process look like? Where do they need to go and what do they need to do? 21:21 – Guest: Figure out where they want to host. Choose [Heroku.](https://www.heroku.com)25:39 – Nader: Yeah I was going to ask about the client. What about documentations are concerned – where could they go? 25:53 – Guest. 28:12 – Nader: Any picks for today? **<u>Links: </u>**
