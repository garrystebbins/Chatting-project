React Native Radio – Episode 118 **<u>Panel:</u>** Spencer Carli Nader Dabit **<u>Special Guests:</u>** Michael Lynn and Drew Dipalma In today’s episode of the React Native Radio Podcast, the panel talks with Michael Lynn and Drew Dipalma about Mongo DB Stitch and Atlas. The panel and guests talk in-detail about the databases. Check out today’s episode to hear all the details! **<u>Topics and Questions Discussed:</u>** 0:34 – Nader talks about the topic for today’s discussion. 1:13 – Michael gives his professional background and his discusses his current job at Mongo DB. He has been an architect and an engineer, too. 2:04 – Drew talks about his background, too. 3:03 – Nader: Please give us an elevator pitch, please, for Mongo DB. 3:15 – Guest answers the question. 4:53 – Guest continues and talks about Stitch, and talks about what it offers and how it can help users. 6:44 – Nader summarizes the two guests’ answers. 6:59 – Guest clarifies some features about Stitch. 7:33 – Guest: Mongo DB Atlas is the management console and Stitch is more of a development platform. 7:53 – Nader asks more follow-up questions. 8:12 – Guest: Atlas you can deploy over the Cloud providers, and that is our eventual goal for Stitch. 8:46 – Nader: This seems very similar to firebase? 8:53 – Guest: In many ways it is. 11:16 – Nader: What typically do people use to call the backend? Are they using the client-side code that they’ve written in the past or are there certain HEK’s that they need to use instead? 11:33 – Guest answers the question. 12:44 – Nader: That is really cool. I was thinking how to invoke these? I was thinking of the different ways. So the preferred way is to...? (Nader mentions [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=ACQ-P%7CPS-GO%7CBrand%7CDesktop%7CSU%7CCore-Main%7CCore%7CUS%7CEN%7CText&sc_content=Brand_aws_e&sc_detail=aws&sc_category=Core&sc_segment=315739797251&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!315739797251!e!!g!!aws&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIo6yS-YiP4QIVFLbICh3J5AEhEAAYASAAEgKQKfD_BwE:G:s).) 13:12 – Guest answers the question. 13:29 – Guest: I spend a lot of time thinking about how developers can solve problems with the tools that are available via Mongo DB. He talks about command lines, and commander JS. 14:39 – Spencer: What does mobile sync actually look like? 15:03 – Guest answers the question. 19:03 – Nader mentions JavaScript, full stack applications, and more. Nader: I like the real-time stuff. Is there anything else you want to touch-on? 19:39 – Guest: Not sure how much about the backend you want to know? 20:05 – Nader: I do want to get into that but let’s talk about the real-time stuff. I am looking at the website. Sync is to sync the delta and what you have locally. Is that when you go offline and then come back online? 20:30 – Guest talks about the goals of sync. 20:57 – Nader: It’s a hard thing to get right, but if you can it can really help, since it’s an in-demand feature. A lot of that would have to do with your client implication, right? 21:19 – Guest continues. 21:39 – Nader: I guess my last question is what is the implementation of the Stitch triggers? 21:58 – Guest: From the client’s perspective? 22:05 – Guest answers the question, and talks more about how Stitch works. 23:47 – Nader: One thing is that when you are working with server-less functions you have to deal with the warm-up time. I am guessing that is not the case for Stich or Atlas? 24:09 – Guest: The overhead is so much less than spitting-up a container. It’s not really something you perceive. The other thing with containers is that they have a cold start because you have to make connections. 25:50 – Nader: We talked about some of the stuff that you can do – anything else you want to highlight to building the full stack application? What other things do you want to highlight? 26:27 – Guest: The one thing about Stitch is its rules. 28:21 – Nader: It seems farfetched, but is there anything out there that is like this? It seems like a “new” way of doing things, but at the same time I can see some similarities with other things that are happening within the industry? Is this a new way of doing things? 29:00 – Guest: There is some overlap. 29:35 – Spencer: If we take a step-back, I have been frontend for a few years. Say I want to go into fullstack stuff, what do you recommend into learning Mongo? Any resources? Any suggestions? 30:13 – Guest: It depends on your background. 31:51 – Nader: That was going to be my next question but he [guest] covered that. Is there anything specific for Reactive Native developers?
