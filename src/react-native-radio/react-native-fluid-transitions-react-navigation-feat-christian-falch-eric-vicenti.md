**<u>Special</u>** <u> <strong>Guests</strong>:</u> Christian Falch and Eric Vicenti In today’s episode of the React Native Radio Podcast, the panel talks with Christian and Eric about various topics; such as: Flow, Flutter, C, C++, React Native, React, React Navigation, and much more! Check out today’s episode to hear all of the details. **<u>Topics and Questions Discussed: </u>** 0:13 – Nader: Welcome to the show. Christian has been working on an interesting library that works with navigation. Tell us about yourself Christian! 0:56 – Christian: I am 47 years old now and so it’s a long story. I have been coding since 11 years old. If you wanted to play some games you had to make them yourself. 1:59 – Nader: You have been coding for 36-37 years now – you must be well versed now, right? 2:15 – Christian: Yes. 4:25 – Nader: So what is the company that you actually run now? What are you involved with now? 4:36 – Guest: It’s a small consultancy company and there are only two of us. Our main focus is Reactive Native. We are doing things from apps to helping customers with their issues. 5:15 – Nader: I know you’ve had some experience with Android Native and others – why did you go to React Native and how has that worked for your business? 5:29 – Guest: This is another great story. 10:19 – Nader: One last question before we get into the topic. You have a daughter in the entertainment industry – can you tell us about that? 10:40 – Guest: Yes, she is 22-years old and she’s an actress. She has been given a lot of opportunities and I have been helping her. It’s a series that launches through [Facebook Launch](https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/introducing-watch-and-shows-on-facebook). It has become a big thing in Europe. 11:20 – Nader: Let’s get on the topic. Can you tell us why you made the library, and why would someone want to try it out? 11:35 – Guest: Sure! 17:29 – Panel: I am curious what has gone into building this library? Were you able to build on top of a stack navigator or tab navigator or any of those? 17:48 – Guest. 18:05 – Panel: It’s cool to see these building blocks and laying layers on top of that. Building awesome stuff. 18:28 – Nader: It looks like a combination of an animated library and a navigations library. What’s the best way to use this library? 18:50 – Guest. 19:27 – Nader: Ok cool. When you transition away from a screen can you declare those as well or does it do the opposite of the incoming transition? 19:36 – Guest: Both – pairing and pairing transitions. You can write your own transitions, too! 20:42 – Nader: How much extra code do people need to write? How much do they need to know about animations? 21:00 – Guest. 22:41 – Nader: Have you worked on [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) over the years or is this new to you and your company? 22:50 – Guest: It’s actually quite new for me. 23:45 – Nader: Do you use typescript or does it depend on the project? 24:00 – Guest: We have been very successful with FLOW. 24:21 – Panel: Working with these different technologies – are there pros/cons working within React Native or JavaScript or anything that you miss from those different platforms when coming to React Native? 24:45 – Guest: Not at all. 26:25 – Nader: Have you looked at Flutter? 26:30 – Guest. 27:38 – Panel: You’ve been toying with Reanimated is that right, and you’ve been having a good experience? 27:45 – Guest: It’s an answer to a lot of my questions. It’s a great library and it’s really flexible. 30:30 – Nader: That’s cool that you can work with your existing code. 30:44 – Guest: My hope is that... 32:108 – Nader: Eric, I know you are working on [React Navigations](https://reactnavigation.org), in general, and there might be a new version coming out? 32:22 – Eric: Yep! **<u>Links: </u>**
