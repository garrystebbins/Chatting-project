**React Native Radio | Episode 102\*\*** &nbsp; \***\*Panel:** Nader Dabit Spencer Carli **Special Guests:** Gant LaBorde In this episode of React Native Radio, the panel talks to Gant LaBorde. Gant is usually a panelist on the show and he works with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) for a company called [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red/), which allows him to go around to conferences and speak as well as work on cool new technology and open source.&nbsp; They talk about conferences, state management in React, his article [_The React State Museum_](https://hackernoon.com/the-react-state-museum-a278c726315), and how state management is different now. They also touch on the great benefit of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), the blessing and a curse that is the ability to have multiple options for state management systems in React, and more! **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
