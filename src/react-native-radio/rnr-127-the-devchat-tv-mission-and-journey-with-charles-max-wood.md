### **Episode Summary**

Charles talks about his journey as a podcaster and his mission with [Devchat.tv](https://devchat.tv/). Devchat.tv&nbsp; is designed to home podcasts that speak to all developer communities. Charles also plans Devchat.tv to host shows for technologies that are on the verge of a breakthrough and will be a lot more widely available in the near future such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). There are new shows being added continuously to reach out to new communities, some examples of which are: a Data Science show, a DevOps show and an Open Source show. As a kid, Charles would record his own shows on a tape recorder. He was always interested in technology. While studying Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University, he worked in the University's Operations Center. Upon graduation, he started working for Mozy where he was introduced to podcasts. Listen to the show to find out the rest of Charles' story, some of the lessons and tips he learned throughout his journey and the evolution of the shows on Devchat.tv. If there isn't a show for your community and you would like there one to be, reach out to [Charles.](https://@cmaxw) Also if there was a podcast about a programming related subject that ended abruptly and you would like it to continue, reach out to [Charles.](https://@cmaxw) Devchat.tv would like to host these podcasts.
