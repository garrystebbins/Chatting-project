**<u>Panel:</u>** [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3)[Gant LaBorde](http://gantlaborde.com) **<u>Special Guest:</u>** [Christoph Nakazawa](https://twitter.com/cpojer)In today’s episode of the React Native Radio Podcast, the panel talks with [Christoph Nakazawa](https://twitter.com/cpojer) who works through React Native and open source. The guest and the panelists discuss React Native, [MooTools](https://mootools.net/), [Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313), and much more! Be on the lookout for upcoming conferences with great discussion topics that will be presented soon! **<u>Topics and Questions Discussed:</u>** 0:11 – Nader welcomes everyone to the show. Nader makes note of the guest and the panel. 0:43 – Nader: For those who don’t know you, could you please offer your background? 0:55 – Guest: I am involved with the open source, side of things, through React Native. I am involved with building the community through the React Native group. The guest starts his journey back 14-years ago. 4:56 – Panelist: Do you want to tell us the steps you’ve taken from there to here? 5:25 – Guest answers the question. 12:42 – Nader: It’s insightful. It’s cool to see how it all comes together. Question from Nader to Gant. 13:15 – Panelist: It’s great to have a community help out. That specific project can be your focus for 6-8 months, and to have help is great! 15:31 – Panelist: Did you get weird information from people where they shared what they didn’t like? 15:41 – Guest: It was a great exercise to see where the community was coming from. We have a huge infrastructure built around the open source. 19:59 – Panelist: If someone has a question, how does the community respond to such a query? 20:24 – Guest: To go back about your gratitude – there are tons of other engineers that have contributed in a huge way. I appreciate it, though. The guest talks about [Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313). 27:27 – Nader chimes-in. 27:41 – Guest. 27:44 – Panelist: We are standing here and looking at a lot of great progress. What does the future look like? Say in the next 6 months? Are we refining the same or are we doing something else? What can we expect? 28:13 – Guest: There are a lot of things I cannot discuss, but... 31:06 – Nader: That’s exciting! I didn’t know about the updated website. Is that something that you’ve been kicking around? 31:15 – Guest: Yes, but we haven’t started working on it, yet; although we have some ideas. 31:25 – Nader: You mentioned [MooTools](https://mootools.net/). Can we talk about that some more? Tell us about your connection, please. 32:06 – Nader: I think [jQuery](https://jquery.com) was my first thing. 32:10 – Guest. 37:09 – Nader: What are some tips that you’d like to offer in the realm of open source? 37:35 – Guest answers the question. 40:00 – Nader: Anything else? 40:06 – Guest: I am good. 40:11 – Nader: It’s been great – I like how you mentioned the encouragement aspect. 41:00 – Guest. 4:55 – Nader: Picks! **<u>Links:</u>**
