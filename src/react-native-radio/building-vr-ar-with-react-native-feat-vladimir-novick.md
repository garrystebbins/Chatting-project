Check out today’s episode to learn more! **<u>Topics and Questions Discussed: </u>** 0:35 – Nader: Is this the first time you’ve been on here before? 0:44 – Guest: I’ve been on [here](https://devchat.tv/react-native-radio/building-iot-applications-with-react-native-feat-vladimir-novick/) in the past. 0:52 – Nader: You probably know of him, but tell us who you are, please! &nbsp; 1:00 – Guest: I work with a consulting company who works mostly with full stack. I usually have a joke. I speak at conferences about topics like AR. 1:44 – Nader: Whom do you work with in Israel? 1:53 – Guest: Most of the clients are in U.S. time zones. We do some cool stuff with location-base. I have my own consultancy. I could have multiple clients at one time. I travel to the U.S. and Europe and I give workshops on React Native and web in general. 3:02 – Nader: Our topics are VR and AR. What is this like to get into this field? React or Reactive Native? 3:21 – Guest: With AR it has a huge history of development. In recent years and great developments are there. The React Native scene..._(The guest talks about AR in lots of detail.)\_6:00 – Nader: It’s interesting that you said... For me I have a huge fan of [Viro-React](https://viromedia.com/viroreact/) and I was learning how to lay things out in 3D space. Can you talk about the concepts that people should learn when they are getting started? 6:42 – Guest: The thing is that when we think about AR apps we need to think about... 10:21 – Panel: I have seen stuff like 3JF is that a good thing to build AR and VR stuff? 10:32 – Guest. 11:22 – Panel: When it comes to placing something to a space and then turning around and wee that item stick there – could you tell us how that works? 11:48 – Guest. Guest: The AR understands the horizontal and vertical plane. If the lights are pretty good in the environment you can scan and then it’s pretty good. That’s how it works under the hood. Not only can you recognize an object but also... 15:57 – Panel: When I think of a can of a coke it will flatten it and in my mind it will flatten the Coke can. I am assuming I am way off to that how it works? Do you know how they store them? 16:32 – Guest: Yes, they save it with... These yellow dots are special points and coordinates. I don’t’ know the specifications, though. 17:54 – Nader: That’s a good explanation. You have a set of objects that you can detect and if it can be detected then you have a function that can be triggered. 18:10 – Guest. That’s right._(Guest goes into detail...)_19:20 – Panel: Going to a previous question. I wanted to talk about those anchor points that you mentioned. We talked about pings and walls. I want to build a module...how would I go about building that? Is there a way to help me be aware of the box that I am inside that it is one flat surface that I am looking at and what about water? 20:17 – Guest: To recognize all these different surfaces then you have to scan it. In order to be aware of every detail in the room you have to go and scan things. You have vertical and horizontal surfaces. That’s why most of the AR apps are based on scanning a... Especially with water you don’t have to do that b/c you can create particle affects that... 22:09 – Nader: That is an interesting question. Getting up and running and working with VERO and not knowing much I was able to change and update stuff. 22:40 – Guest: One important thing with VERO is that you need... 24:02 – in terms where this is going what are the features that are coming out in the next year or two? What is the cutting and bleeding edge in this? 24:24 – Guest: I have an idea that some things are coming... If you look at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/ios/augmented-reality/) you will see development positions._(The guest also discusses new features with headsets. Also, talking about VR and you can feel weather and temperature changes, too.)_28:47 – Nader: Sounds like [READY PLAYER ONE.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/)28:54 – Guest: The suit is already there from [Ready Player One.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/) The treadmill that he uses it’s on Kickstarter now. The headset isn’t there, yet, but we will be there in the next several years. 29:39 – Nader: How to get started with VR and AR? 29:50 – Guest: It depends on if you want to focus on: web or mobile. You can check out A Frame or... 31:14 - (\_Guest continues to give the listeners some guides to how to get started within these fields. He emphasizes that it really depends on which direction one wants to go: mobile, web, etc.)\_31:23 – Nader: When you say WEB are you saying to develop \_on_ the web and then ship to other devices or...? Let’s talk about how to deploy these things – web technologies? 32:45 – (_Guest talks about the differences between web and mobile, and answers Nader’s question._) 34:32 – Nader: You have to have a cable-enabled phone if you want to do AR – that’s a given I guess. 34:36 – Guest: You can do on regular web, too.\_(Guest continues this topic.)\_35:19 – Nader: I learned a lot today, so thank you!
