**React Native Radio | Episode 96\*\*** &nbsp; \***\*Panel:** Nader Dabit Peter Piekarczyk **Special Guests:** Tyler McGinnis In this episode of React Native Radio, the panelists talk to Tyler McGinnis. Tyler works full time on his website [TylerMcGinnis.com](https://tylermcginnis.com/), does a lot of teaching and blog posts, and has built out [Udacity’s React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). They talk about the new React APIs that are coming out and discuss using [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the web.
