 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Tomek Sułkowski

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Tomek Sułkowski. Tomek was recently on [Adventures in Angular](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular) on [Episode 191](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-191-making-angular-easy-with-tomek-sulkowski) where they talked about UX in [Angular](https://angular.io/). He currently works as a front-end engineer for an app creating company, as well as has been working for [Sages](http://sages.io/) running front-end workshops over Angular.

They talk about how he got into [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), what drew him to Angular, what he is working on currently, and more!
