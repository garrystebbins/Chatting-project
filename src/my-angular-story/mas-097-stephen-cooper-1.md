question1: What are some of the hardest things you have solved with Angular at Auth0?
answer1: >-
  When it comes to you know that the latest Angular Angular release. One of the
  big things that that I've been focusing on for the last two years is figuring
  out how do we authenticate. How do we make the authentication story within
  Angular applications as simple as it can be.
question2: How did you get introduced to AngularJS?
answer2: >-
  This was back in 2013 2014 and we had been running this very old traditional
  ASP. NET C sharp stack and we decided we needed to modernize we needed modern
  features. And I was put in charge of picking a front end framework did to kind
  of replace that. So I was evaluating knockouts evaluating Ember and then I
  stumbled upon Angular JS.
