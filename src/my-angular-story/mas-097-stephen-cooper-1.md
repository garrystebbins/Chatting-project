  When it comes to you know that the latest Angular Angular release. One of the
  big things that that I've been focusing on for the last two years is figuring

  Angular applications as simple as it can be.
question2: How did Ado Kukic get introduced to AngularJS?
answer2: >-
  This was back in 2013 2014 and we had been running this very old traditional
  ASP. NET C # stack and we decided we needed to modernize we needed modern
  features. And I was put in charge of picking a front end framework did to kind
  of replace that. So I was evaluating knockouts evaluating Ember and then I
  stumbled upon Angular JS.
question3: What are some of the challenges of with authentication ?
answer3: >-
  Such a challenging aspect, you know, even if you're building a traditional web
  application, there's still all sorts of considerations here, you have to take
  into account all sorts of vulnerabilities to worry about.
