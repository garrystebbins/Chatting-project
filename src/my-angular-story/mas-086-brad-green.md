## Episode Summary

Brad Green is an engineering director at Google. He has been ​managing the Angular team for the past 12 years. Brad talks about his Angular journey and explains how having a supportive Angular community outside of Google has helped them with the Angular development inside Google and especially finding new team members for the Angular team. Brad talks about what he has learned over the past 12 years on building such a popular product and how he got Google to support it. He also talks about how he came about using the phrase "You can sit with us". Brad has recently made a decision to leave Google and so he and Aaron discuss what is next for Brad and what this means for the Angular community.
