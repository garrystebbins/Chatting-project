**Panel:** Charles Max Wood **Guest:** Merrick Christensen This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Merrick Christensen. Christensen works at a company called [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), where they try to empower people to create software without code. The company is similar to [Squarespace](<https://www.squarespace.com/?channel=pbr&subchannel=go&campaign=branded-united-states-squarespace&subcampaign=(search-global-branded_squarespace_e)&source=us_brand&variation=229703139831&gclid=CjwKCAiA5OrTBRBlEiwAXXhT6HGLp3ZyXBxHELHdplsnSw25auTqIo>) or [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), except they give 100% design control to the client. Christensen talks about his journey into programming, starting by creating websites for his childhood band.
