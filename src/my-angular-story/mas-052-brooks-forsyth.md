 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** [Brooks Forsyth](https://twitter.com/brooks_forsyth)

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with [Brooks Forsyth](https://twitter.com/brooks_forsyth) who is frontend developer who has been doing this for four years. He works for a large consulting corporation who will remain nameless, and he lives in Harper, Connecticut.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

4:09 – Chuck: I would like to dive in. How did you get into Angular in the first place?

4:20 Guest: I was at a service desk in CT. One of my jobs was to open 75 different emails and make sure that it didn’t send an “error” message. I had to make sure nothing failed. That was boring. I used Auto Hot Key. That was fun, and did a lot of that there, which got me into programming. I had a Bachelor’s in Business. Went to get my Master’s in Computer Science, but took along time. Started doing IT recruiting. Then next thing you know I moved into my parents’ house and did coder camps. And that worked out. Then I got hired by the Charter Internet Company. Now I am in large consulting firm in CT.

6:40 – Chuck asks another question.

6:349 – Guest: When I was picking coding camps I chose the one that was teaching Angular.

7:30 – Chuck: What do you do in your spare time?

7:38 – Guest: I have 2 kids who are 4 years old and 1 years old. I have a really cool fish tank that has coral reef in it.

8:00 – Chuck: Which Angular project was your favorite?

8:09 – Guest: Ionic Project was a lot of fun. The app was already written and I was to convert it. In theory not change the backend. I had a lot of fun making that app. I love working with Ionic.

9:37 – Chuck: Ionic is going into other frameworks.

10:05 – Chuck: I have feelings about the show, The View.

10:37 – Chuck: what is your workflow in Angular?

10:44 – Guest answers question. Brooks mentions [jQuery](https://jquery.com) during this timestamp.

11:50 – Chuck: What is your involvement in the community?

12:00 – Guest: I participate in the Slack. Answer questions in there.

12:39 – Chuck: There are a lot of people in the background helping people out in the chat room. There is another person on the other end helping others.

13:06 – Guest: I could be doing CSS but I rather be doing this instead. I don’t mind answering any questions or prodding the person to get more information. “What are the steps to recreate it?” And my answer was...

14:09 – Chuck: I worked through Q/A for a while. And it is interesting.

14:25 – You don’t want to brush them off completely because they are obviously frustrated.

14:43 – Chuck: What are you working on now.

14:50 – Guest answers question.

15:03 – Chuck: Anything you’d like for people to know about you?

15:22 – Guest: I can make something up real quick...

15:30 – Chuck: How you are contributing is awesome, just thought to ask.

15:48 – Guest: I do enjoy helping out in the chat community. Also, talking with the other developers.

16:10 – Picks!
