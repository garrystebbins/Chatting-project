Thomas Burleson, a Solutions Architect from West Des Moines, Iowa join Aaron Frost in this week's My Angular Story.  Thomas shares his journey as a developer and how he was introduced to Angular. 

Thomas was an Applied Physics major in college and when he failed a programming class he never thought he would be a developer. But then he wanted to know what was behind the software he was using and he taught himself how to program.
