**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Juri Strumpflohner

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Juri Strumpflohner. Juri is a software developer that works with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), and more recently, he has created&nbsp;[training courses&nbsp;](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner)on&nbsp;[Egghead](https://egghead.io/). He first got into programming when he was about 11 or 12 years old and he was always really interested with playing around on his Dad’s computer. They talk about coming into programming through curiosity, how he got into [Angular](https://angular.io/) and JavaScript, and his switch to working on single page applications, and more!
