**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** TJ VanToll

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with TJ VanToll. TJ is a front-end developer that currently works for [Progress](https://www.progress.com/) and spends his time working with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/). He first got into programming in middle school when he built a Final Fantasy fan site back in the time when GeoCities was popular. He then in high school helped run the school’s website and in college majored in computer programming. They talk about how his journey to get to where he is today has influenced his life and what his day to day life looks like now as a developer advocate.

**In particular, We dive pretty deep on:**
