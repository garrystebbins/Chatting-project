question1: 'Why did you decide to speak at conferences? '
answer1: >-
  Being a speaker at conferences gives people a chance to come and talk to you
  and ask you questions and helps you develop a better network.
question2: >-
  What do you recommend to those looking to submit a proposal to give a talk at
  a conference?
answer2: >-
  It really helps to apply with somebody else, preferably someone more
  experienced. 
question3: 'How experienced do you have to be in the subject you give a talk in? '
answer3: >-
  When I gave a talk on Intro to Bazel, i had never used Bazel so i used that
  opportunity to learn about it. I find that teaching a subject is the best way
  to learn it.

This week My Angular Story welcomes Philip Fulcher, Software Engineer at Hach.  Philip gave his first talk at Angular Denver 2019 on Intro to Bazel with Bonnie Brennan  Aaron wonders why despite years of developers experience,  Philip never gave a talk at a conference before this year. 

 Philip and Aaron discuss some of the best practices of giving a talk at a conference,one of which is not running over the talk's time limit. They also talk about what it takes to get accepted to talk at a conference. Philip mentions he just submitted a proposal to give a talk in JSConf Hawaiʻi which takes place on February 5th-7th 2020 in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi.

One of the interesting tips Philip shares about giving talks at conferences is how often times you will not be the person that knows the most about that subject in the room. But giving a talk gives you a chance for people to come ask you questions and therefore meeting people that you might collaborate or ask for advice from in the future.
