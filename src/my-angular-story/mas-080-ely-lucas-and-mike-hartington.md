### **Episode Summary**
Coming to you live from the podcast booth at [ng-conf 2019](https://www.ng-conf.org/) is Charles Max Wood with Ely Lucas and Mike Hartington. Ely and Mike both work at [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), an app developer platform that helps developers build and deploy cross-platform apps. A heated discussion on who had the beard first ([Jeff Cross](https://twitter.com/jeffbcross?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)&nbsp;or Mike Hartington) ensues, (spoiler alert it's [Jeff Cross](https://twitter.com/jeffbcross?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) because he is OLDER than Mike Hartington) as they try to find out who is running the [@ **HartingtonBeard**](https://twitter.com/HartingtonBeard) Twitter account. Ely and Mike talk about what they have been working on at [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), and the [4.0&nbsp;release of&nbsp;Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/blog/introducing-ionic-4-ionic-for-everyone/). This is Ely's first time at [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/)and Mike's first time giving a talk at it. They talk about how the conference has evolved for the better and what their favorite parts of the conference are. **Links**
