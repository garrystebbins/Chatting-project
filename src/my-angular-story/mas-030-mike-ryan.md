**Panel:** Charles Max Wood **Guest:** Mike Ryan This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Mike Ryan. Mike is a software engineer at [Synapse](https://www.synapse-wireless.com/) in Alabama and works as a tech lead there. He first got into programming when his family stayed with an uncle during a hurricane as a child and was sent home with parts to build his first computer. This really kicked off his interest in programming and problem-solving. He then created websites to help pay for some of his living costs when in college, and this is what led him to discovering [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/). **In particular, We dive pretty deep on:&nbsp;**
