**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** [Bonnie Brennan](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/bonnie-brennan)

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with [Bonnie Brennan](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/bonnie-brennan) who is in web technologies and uses Angular. She currently resides in Houston, Texas and Chuck and her discuss her background, past and current projects, [ngHouston Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ngHouston/), and much more! Check-out today’s episode!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

1:00 – Chuck: We’ve talked with you in the past, Bonnie. So listeners, check-out those past episodes if you are interested (see links below). There were various topics that we discussed. It’s been a few months since we’ve talked. Tell us how you got into Angular among other things?

1:50 – Guest.

3:19 – Chuck: I want to get a feel for how you got into programming, so tell us about that.

3:40 – Guest: I didn’t start coding until my 30’s.

3:50 – Chuck: Here is a dirty little secret: most people get into coding later in life.

4:25 – Guest.

25:07 – Chuck: Let’s get back on track - How did you get into Angular?

25:10 – Guest.

32:26 – Chuck: I completely agree. As you’ve gone into Angular you’ve done things in the community that makes you well-known. We’ve talked with your child-component, and how she got into coding. Listen back to that. You mentioned [NG Houston](https://www.meetup.com/ngHouston/?_cookie-check=YUAiQQaj1k8mjDwT), how did you get that going?

32:56 – Guest: I was here in Houston...

39:26 – Chuck: I want to change topics here. You mentioned in your consulting that people are running into certain issues. Most consultants that I know, they make a plan and they just build stuff. Seems like you are talking with them and showing them how to make things work better.

39:54 – Guest.

45:11 – Chuck: I have been a freelancer, and how do people hire you?

45:23 – Guest: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bonnster75?lang=en) is the best way to reach out to me, also my e-mail.

46:59 – Chuck: You have been a GD – how has that been?

47:10 – Guest: I actually love it! [GOOGLE DEVELOPER EXPERT = GDE](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/bonnie-brennan).

49:07 – Chuck: You had a unique experience at the last Summit. Can you talk about that for a minute?

49:17 – Guest.

59:17 – Chuck: We are at the end of our time. Where can people find you?

59:30 – Guest: The YouTube Channel and [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/bonnster75?lang=en)

1:00:54 – Chuck: Let’s do some picks!
