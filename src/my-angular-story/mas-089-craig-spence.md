**Episode Summary**

Craig Spence joins Aaron Frost at [Angular Denver](https://angulardenver.com/) to tell his story about how he started developing with Angular. Craig switched majors from Music to Multimedia Systems Engineering in university. He interned for [Weta Digital ](https://www.wetafx.co.nz/)using Python and there he realized how powerful the web was. He then went to work for [Trade Me](https://www.trademe.co.nz/),  the eBay of New Zealand. There he worked in a team migrating the website from AngularJS to Angular. Because they couldn't take the website down they had to re-write from scratch. Craig shares his experiences and lessons learned from this migration. He recently started a new job at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) as a Senior Engineer in Sweden.
