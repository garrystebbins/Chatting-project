**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Victor Savkin

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Victor Savkin about his business [Narwhal Technologies](https://nrwl.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=blog-bios&utm_content=personal). In addition, they discuss Angular, past and current business projects, and their picks. Victor is a co-founder of [nrwl.io](https://nrwl.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=blog-bios&utm_content=personal), providing Angular consulting to enterprise teams. He was previously on the Angular core team at Google, and built the dependency injection, change detection, forms and router modules.
