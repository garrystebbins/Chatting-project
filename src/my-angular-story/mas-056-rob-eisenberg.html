<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with</span><span class="s6"> <a href="https://twitter.com/eisenbergeffect?lang=en"><span class="s5">Rob Eisenberg</span></a> who is a principal software engineer at InVision, and is the creator of Caliburn.Micro, Durandal, and Aurelia. Today, they talk about Rob’s past and current projects among other things. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">1:40 – Chuck: Our special guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/EisenbergEffect?lang=en"><span class="s5">Rob Eisenberg</span></a>. We’ve had you on Adventures on Angular (<a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/009-aia-ng-2-0-with-rob-eisenberg/"><span class="s5">09</span></a> and <a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/080-aia-aurelia-with-rob-eisenberg/"><span class="s5">80</span></a>), JavaScript Jabber, and others like <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/203-jsj-aurelia-with-rob-eisenberg/"><span class="s5">Episode 203.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">2:36 – Rob: That was over the period of 4 years all of those podcasts. I am getting older.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">2:50 – Chuck: Anything that you’ve done that you want to talk about?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">3:04 – Rob: I am known for opensource work over the years. Maybe we can talk about my progression through that over the years.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">3:25 – Chuck: How did you get into this field? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">3:29 – Rob: When I was 8 years old my dad wanted to buy a computer. We went to Sears and we bought our first computer. You’d buy the disk drive and the keyboard looking unit. You could by a monitor, we didn’t, but we used a black and white TV for our monitor. Later we bought the colored monitor and printer. That’s where my fascination started. We set up the computer in my bedroom. We played games. I got intrigued that you could write code to make different games. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">It was just magical for me. As being an adult engineer I am trying to go back to that moment to recapture that magical moment for me. It was a great creative outlet. That’s how I first started. I started learning about Q basic and other flavors of Basic. Then I heard about C! I remember you could do anything with C. I went to the library and there wasn’t the Internet, yet. There were 3 books about C and read it and re-read it. I didn’t have any connections nor a compiler. When I first learned C I didn’t have a compiler. I learned how to learn the codes on notebook paper, but as a kid this is what I first started doing. I actually saved some of this stuff and I have it lying around somewhere. I was big into adventure games. That’s when I moved on <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s5">C++</span></a> and printed out my source code! It’s so crazy to talk about it but at the time that’s what I did as a kid. In JHS there was one other kid that geeked-out about it with me. It was a ton of fun. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Then it was an intense hobby of mine. Then at the end of HS I had 2 loves: computers and percussion. I was composing for music, too. I had to decide between music or coding. I decided to go with music. It was the best decision I ever made because I studied music composition. When you are composing for dozens of instruments to play one unified thing. Every pitch, every rhythm, and it all works together. Why this note and why that rhythm? There is an artistic side to this and academia, too. The end result is that music is enjoyed by humans; same for software. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I did 2 degrees in music and then started my Master’s in Music. I then realized I love computers, too, how can I put these two together? I read some things on audio programming, and it stepped me back into programming. At this time, I was working in music education and trying to compose music for gamming. Someone said look at this program called <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/"><span class="s5">C#!</span></a> I don’t know cause...how can you get any better than <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s5">C++?!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">In 2003 – I saw a book: teach yourself <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/"><span class="s5">C#</span></a> in 24 hours. I read it and I was enthralled with how neat this was! I was building some Windows applications through C#. I thought it was crazy that there was so much change from when I was in college. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">17:00 – Chuck: You start making this transition to web? What roped you in? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">17:25 – Rob: I realized the power of this, not completely roped in just, yet. Microsoft was working (around this time) with...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">19:45 – (Continued from Rob): When Silver Light died that’s when I looked at the web. I said forget this native platform. I came back to JavaScript for the 2</span><span class="s7"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s2"> time – and said I am going to learn this language with the same intensity as I learned C++ and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/"><span class="s5">C#.</span></a> I started working with Durandal. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">21:45 – Charles: Yeah, I remember when you worked with the router and stuff like that. You were on the core team. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">21:53 – Rob: The work I did on that was inspired by screen activation patterns. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">23:41 – Rob (continued): I work with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com"><span class="s5">InVision</span></a> now. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">24:14 – Charles: I remember you were on the Angular team and then you transitioned – what was that like?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">24:33 – Rob comments. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">25:28 – Rob (continued): I have been doing opensource for about 13 years. I almost burned myself a few times and almost went bankrupt a few times. The question is how to be involved, but run the race without getting burned-out. It’s a marathon not a sprint. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">These libraries are huge assets. Thank God I didn’t go bankrupt but became very close.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The more popular something if there are more varieties and people not everyone is so pleasant. It’s okay to disagree. Now what are the different opinions and what works well for your team and project? It’s important to stay to your core and vision. Why would you pick THIS over THAT?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">It’s a fun and exciting time if you are</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">28:41 – Charles: What are you</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">28:47 – Rob: InVision and InVision studio. It’s a tool for designing screens. I work on that during the day and during the night I work on Aurelia. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">30:43 – Chuck: I am pretty sure that we have had people from InVision on a show before.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">31:03 – Rob comments. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Rob: How we all work together.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">31:20 – What is coming in with <a href="https://twitter.com/AureliaEffect"><span class="s5">Aurelia</span></a> next?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">31:24 – Rob: We are trying to work with as much backwards compatibility as we can. So you don’t see a lot of the framework code in your app code. It’s less intrusive. We are trying next, can we keep the same language, the same levels, and such but change the implementation under the hood. You don’t learn anything new. You don’t have new things to learn. But how it’s implemented it’s smaller, faster, and more efficient. We have made the framework more pluggable to the compiler-level. It’s fully supported and super accessible. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Frameworks will come and go – this is my belief is that you invest in the standards of the web. We are taking that up a notch. Unobtrusiveness is the next thing we want to do. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We’ve always had great performance and now taking it to the next level. We are doing a lot around documentation. To help people understand what the architectural decisions are and why? We are taking it to the next level from our core. It’s coming along swimmingly so I am really excited. We’ve already got 90% test coverage and over 40,000 tests. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">37:33 – Chuck: Let’s get you on JavaScript Jabber! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">38:19 – Chuck: Where can people find you?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">38:22 – Twitter, and everywhere else. <a href="https://aurelia.io/blog/"><span class="s5">Blog!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">39:17 – Chuck: Picks?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">39:23 – Rob dives in!</span></p>
