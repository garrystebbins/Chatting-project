**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Stephen Fluin

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Stephen Fluin. Stephen is a developer advocate on the [Angular Core Team](https://angular.io/about?group=Angular) at Google. His role has two parts: to help developers and organizations be successful with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and to reflect the needs of those developers and understand what it’s like to actually build apps in the real world onto the team so that they can make the right product decisions as they continue to build out Angular. He first got into programming when he was 8 years old and he was interested in how computer games were created and started creating his own games in C and C++.
