<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Panel:</span><span class="s2"><b> </b>Charles Max Wood</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guest:</span><span class="s2"> David Bush</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with</span><span class="s4"> David Bush who is working with Bloomberg after twenty (plus!) years of being self-employed. Charles and David talk about his current projects he’s working on, plus his impressive background. Listen to them talk about JavaScript, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s5">C++,</span></a> David’s books, and much more! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">1:34 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-203-where-to-store-angular-configurations-with-dave-bush/"><span class="s5">Episode 203</span></a>, which came out a few months ago. Check-out this past episode with David. <a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-203-where-to-store-angular-configurations-with-dave-bush/"><span class="s5">“Where to Store Angular Configurations” with Dave Bush. </span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">2:13 – Chuck: We are here to catch your story. Let people know who you are.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">2:27 – David: I have been in programming for 30 years. Recently in the .NET space, and also in the Angular space for 4 years. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">3:02 – Chuck: JavaScript has been around for 20 years. How did</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">3:12 – David: I need to back-up a little bit. It’s unique. I wasn’t raised around computers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">3:43 – Chuck: We are having a microphone issue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">3:55 – David: I didn’t have access to a computer back in the day. By the time I got to college I knew summer camps and maintenance. Senior year the PC started making a break-through. I had friends who made computers in their dorm room. That looked really interesting. I mean build by soldering, and pretty hardcore. I went to engineering school. Senior year, but I went to school on a large portion of grants. It was too late to change my major. I worked for Radio Shack in Chicago. They encouraged us to bring things home. I brought these computers home and played with them. I got into Pascal among other things. I couldn’t get Pascal to work in my brain. Next, I learned C. If I cannot make C work then I will give up and do something else with my life. C was mathematical and that’s my brain. My wife encouraged me to go back to school – I went to DePaul through their Career Change Path. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">7:14 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">7:18 – David: It was similar to a boot camp. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">7:43 – David and Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">7:52 – Chuck: When did you settle on JavaScript?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">7:55 – David: <i>Settle.</i> When the Internet became publically available and wrote my website through Notepad. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">David continues this conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">9:30 – Chuck: Are you primarily a Dot Net developer?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">9:43 – David: Primarily; also, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s5">C++. </span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">10:55 – Chuck: How did you get into being self-employed?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">11:07 – David: That was the plan all along. When you are self-employed you have multiple bosses! I got fired from my last job and working with agencies. So I count that time as being self-employed then, too. In 2000, I switched to LLC and more direct contracts. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">12:45 – Chuck: How do you find contracts?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">12:51 – David: Started working for Bloomberg and then later they converted me to being an employer. It was attractive, so I am not an employee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">13:24 – Chuck: What things are you proud of and what contributions have you made within the community? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">13:29 – David: The writing in my blogs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">14:20 – Chuck: How do you get into blogging – and how is it successful?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">14:44 – David: Keep writing. Sometimes I think: this article will be awesome and it will fall flat. But then the times I don’t think it’s good those are the articles that blowup. You can’t tell. The other thing is you need to have a thick skin. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">15:29 – Chuck: True with podcasting as well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">15:36 – David: You will never make anyone happy. You learn to read the comment for the content and not the attitude behind it. Take the value out of the content that you can. The blog is just for me. I write so I have some place to point my colleagues to. It’s for me to retrieve information. The blog really is for me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">16:56 – Chuck: What are you working on now? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">17:00 – David answers this question. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">19:07 – David continues the talk. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">David: I posted my book through GitHub and took it off of Amazon. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">A long-term goal of mine is...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I am interested in functional programming, too. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">20:41 – Chuck: That’s cool. I am a huge fan of making things accessible of where they are at. The Vue portion of Angular why couldn’t we switch that out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">21:08 – David: Dependency injection doesn’t mix well l with React. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">For all of my code, I put all my logic in...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">21:45 – Chuck: How can people find you?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">21:53 – David: LinkedIn is my best one. <a href="https://twitter.com/davembush?lang=en"><span class="s5">Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/DaveMBush"><span class="s5">GitHub</span></a>, etc. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">23:09 – Chuck: LinkedIn. Facebook I am more discerning because I post pictures of my children there. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">23:41 – Chuck: Awesome – if people want to get your book?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">23:50 – David: I will send you those links. See links below.</span></p>
