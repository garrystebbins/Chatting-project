**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Sam Brennan

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Sam Brennan. Sam first got into programming when she was 9 years old and made a website using HTML and CSS. She learned to code from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), has gone on to be a part of [ngGirls](http://ng-girls.org/), and has spoken at conferences, such as at ng-conf 2018 where she gave her [talk on Reusable Animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRP8Uhx-Qo). They talk about how she found her passion for [Angular](https://angular.io/), the importance of not giving up when you are confused, and what she is proud of contributing to the community. They also touch on her involvement in ngGirls as a mentor, what she is working on currently, and more!

**In particular, We dive pretty deep on:**
