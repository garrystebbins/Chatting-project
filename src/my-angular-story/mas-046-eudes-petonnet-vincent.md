**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Eudes Petonnet-Vincent

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Eudes Petonnet-Vincent. Eudes is the technical lead for [Clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/) where he spends most of his days reviewing code and working on a fairly large open source project. He first got into programming in his undergrad when he took computer science classes and was headed towards academia and he discovered that he actually enjoyed programing. They talk about how he discovered [Angular](https://angular.io/), what it was about web development that appealed to him, why he chose Angular, and more!

**In particular, We dive pretty deep on:**
