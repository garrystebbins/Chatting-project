Tero has been doing a lot of Angular in the last 3-4 years working as an independent contractor with many companies around the world.&nbsp;Tero also writes and speaks about his work.Tero has his first introduction to programming when he was about 7 or 8 years old. He and his brother received a Commodore 64 computer which they used for mostly for playing games. On that computer was a basic&nbsp;interpreter and basic programming language which Tero played with a bit. He had some basic code language books for creating some basic adventure games. Tero would painstakingly copy that code but he really had no idea what code was about.In his early twenties, Tero took an internship&nbsp;for software development in 2001. It was in the middle of the big IT bubble. Good timing for Tero because&nbsp;IT companies were hiring everyone. His first stint was as a Java programmer. Tero was beginning a new project and was trying to decide what framework to use. The choice came down to Angular or Ember Backbone.Tero chose Angular because it was the most popular at the time and it felt safe to him.The data binding was intriguing to him. He had learned how to wire things together using Backbone to get model changes shown in the views and making it all work in a clean way. He jumped into Angular to do the same.To hear the rest of&nbsp;_My Angular Story Tero Parviainen_, download and listen&nbsp;to the entire episode.You can connect with Tero and see what he's excited about at the following links.
