 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Aysegul Yonet

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Aysegul Yonet. Aysegul is a Google developer expert for the [Angular](https://angular.io/) team and she works for Narwhal ([Nrwl](https://nrwl.io/)), which is a consulting company that helps big teams build their Angular applications. She first got into programming because she was interested in animation and coding made some aspects of this easier to create. They talk about how she found Angular, the importance of teaching and finding the right resources, and what she is working on now.

**In particular, We dive pretty deep on:**
