**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Sam Julien

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Sam Julien. Sam’s course [Upgrading Angular JS](https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/) is a comprehensive video course to help people tackle the transition from [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) to [Angular](https://angular.io/) which was born out of his own pain and suffering from that process. He first got into programming when he was 8 or 9 and his robotics engineer uncle got him into old Mac computers and he would then hack around on them. They talk about what brought him back to programming, what made him want to specialize in Angular, and more!

**In particular, We dive pretty deep on:**
