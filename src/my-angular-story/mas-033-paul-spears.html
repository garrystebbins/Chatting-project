<p class="p5"><span class="s4">This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with</span><span class="s3"> Paul Spears. Paul works for <a href="https://oasisdigital.com/"><span class="s5">Oasis Digital</span></a>, which is a software development firm based out of St. Louis, and teaches at <a href="https://angularbootcamp.com/"><span class="s5">Angular Boot Camp</span></a>. He first got his career started at Oasis Digital and has been there for around the past 8 years. He first got into programming in early high school/late middle school when he and his Dad would build computers out of scraps they found. This really sparked his interest in computers and led him to pursue software development as a career. They also talk about what he is working on now and what he is most proud of contributing to the community. </span></p>
