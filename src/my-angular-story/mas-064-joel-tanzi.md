0:51 – Chuck: I am talking with Joel – introduce yourself, please!

1:00 – Joel: I am an Angular developer on the front end. I am employed with a company and working on a new app that has to do with security. I am building the front end to that product. I was studying computer engineering at KU, and Angular is my favorite.

2:00 – Chuck: How did you get into programming?

2:04 – Joel: I have always been fascinated with computers. I struggled with mathematics and science in primary school and so I steered away from those topics; therefore my first degree is English literature. Then I fell intro IT support accidentally. Back in 2006 I went through my 2<sup>nd</sup> layoff in my career. My friend asked whether or not I would go back to school, so I did! I went to get my engineering degree and relocated to KU. It took 9 years to get my 2<sup>nd</sup> degree, because I was working fulltime. When I was graduating I talked to an instructor; he mentioned JavaScript at that time. It was exploding in the world at that time. Then I got my first job downtown Kansas City. I haven’t looked back ever since. Have you heard about Knockout? I don’t get the impression that Knockout is popular anymore? (Chuck: No it’s not popular anymore.) I learned Angular and what I like the most about it is that I love how flexible and robust it was/is.

6:32 – Chuck: You found JavaScript and then found Angular – first people to get to Ionic from Angular. How did you get to that point?

6:54 – Joel: Good question! I was fairly new to that job. People already had exposure to it throughout the team/team members.

7:57 – Chuck: How was your transition from Angular 1 to Angular 2?

8:04 – Joel: I was never married to it. I do think that Angular 2 was a major step-up for me and was an important change that needed to happen. It was based on the same concepts.

8:39 – Chuck: What work in Angular are you most proud of?

8:42 – Joel: I think the application I am working on now b/c it looks THE best! Among other things, too. I volunteer through an organization that puts together tech projects for local governments. I got involved with them b/c I wanted more real world experience. It revolves around city streetlights.

11:03 – Chuck: Yeah, Code for America I’ve heard before! Sounds neat!

11:18 – Joel: I would recommend it especially if you are trying to break-into the field. I think community outreach is honorable and it shows initiative.

12:06 – Chuck: Yeah I need to put this into my Get A Coder job

12:23 – Joel: I have met coders within this realm and it’s a great networking opportunity!

12:35 – Chuck: What are you working on now?

12:37 – Joel: [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/create/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=wordpress&creative=277412335409&campaignid=998785131&adgroupid=53026924047&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&sgmt=gb&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&utm_medium=cpc&keyword=wordpress&creative=277412335409&campaignid=998785131&adgroupid=53026924047&matchtype=e&device=c&network=g&targetid=kwd-295456403946&locationid=9027276&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5MLype6Y3wIVCwBpCh2mvQHgEAAYASAAEgI9bvD_BwE) development!

13:46 – Joel (continues): Most lawyers don’t have a website b/c they don’t want to dabble with the technology.

13:59 – Chuck: Cool! I think it’s important to note that your 1<sup>st</sup> degree was literature and you went back to school. For my mom she went back, too. Were you older than the other students?

14:35 – Joel: I have a lot of things that went my way, which I was very blessed. The law firm that I worked for they had a huge support for people getting their degrees. They also gave me the flex hours, too! I am glad that I had that set-up and I know I was extremely blessed to have that support. It’s hard for people to work fulltime and to go to school – it’s definitely a challenge! I am stoked about veterans getting into the coder field and people with diverse backgrounds into this field; it’s very neat!

18:23 – Chuck: How old were you when you made that career change?

18:36 – Joel: In my mid/late thirties!

18:39 – Chuck: People think that they CAN’T go back to school b/c they are too “old” – when that’s not the case! I encourage people to give it a shot.&nbsp;

19:33 – Joel: There is never a better time to get into this work than now.

20:39 – Chuck: Where can people find you online?

20:45 – Joel: At my website – [Stringly Typed!](http://stringlytyped.tech) My [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeltanzi)
