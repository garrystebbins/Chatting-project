### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of My Angular Story, Charles hosts Juan Herrera, Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies and Angular. Listen to Juan on the podcast&nbsp;Adventures in Angular[here](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-220-creating-a-great-community-with-juan-herrera/). Juan started programming at age 14 with a mentor. By the time he started college he already knew most of basic programming concepts. For beginner coders Juan recommends finding a mentor through twitter and just pinging them with questions. Charles also recommends sending them a Starbucks card and then asking them for coding advice over virtual coffee. For people who cannot afford a computer science degree in university, Juan recommends online courses or programs that do not charge a tuition but take a percentage of the paycheck upon employment after graduation. Juan offers many more tips on how to start a programming career and how create and run programming communities correctly.
