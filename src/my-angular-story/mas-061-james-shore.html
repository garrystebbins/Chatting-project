<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:48 – Chuck: Welcome! <a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/aia-205-agile-fluency-with-james-shore/"><span class="s5">James was on a past episode, which was show 205</span></a>! Give us an introduction, please!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:05 – <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com"><span class="s5">James:</span></a> I have been involved with the software industry since 1991. I have written a book and it’s fairly evergreen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:30 – Chuck: Yeah, I remember that’s when the Agile development was getting really, really hot! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:09 – James: Yeah in the early 2000s there was this energy to do software really well, and it seems like it’s turned into this bureaucracy. I find that to be depressing a tiny bit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:50 – Chuck: Yeah, I agree. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:01 – James: Going back to a perspective where excellence is no longer the priority; excellence in your craft. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:31 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:34 – James: Yeah that was Bob Marten. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>James talks about the Agile movement.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:22 – Chuck: This show is a walk back throughout your story. Let’s talk about HOW you got into this stuff. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:40 – <i>James talks about his background.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:58 – <i>Chuck talks about his Grandpa and his experience with technology when he was young.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:10 – James: ...it had a whopping 2K of memory! That’s really how I got involved into programming. Later on I got a Trash 80 then an Apple 2, so I had programming in through my blood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:01 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:08 – <i>James talks about switching between computer and antenna, and his black and white T.V. He also talks about the electrical engineering program at the university. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:16 – Chuck: I studied ad received my computer science degree.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:28 – James.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:34 – Chuck: You have been in the industry since 2001 and you are a bit older than me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:50 – James: My first job was in 1994. Then I wrote some things with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet"><span class="s5">Fido Net</span></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet"><span class="s5">Fido Net</span></a> was this early online form thing. Sort of like Used Net / Used Groups (online bulletin web forms) via the telephone dial-up. They were hobbyists running this out from their home. It was basically chat forms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Once you have some experience (doesn’t matter your degree) – it’s...have you done this before?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:30 – Chuck: This is RIGHT in-line with what I say in my eBook that I am developing now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:00 – James: I didn’t even post that I was looking for a job, but I got very lucky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:15 – Chuck: What is your journey look like and how did you get into Agile development?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:30 – <i>James talks about his Kickstarter, knowledge in JavaScript, programming experience, and more here – check it out!</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:16 – Chuck: How did you get to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"><span class="s5"> Agile</span></a> development? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:31 – James: I was programming throughout my teens. I was working on a really complicated project. I still play Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D). It was the most complicated program that I built at that point. I had it in my head and then I didn’t understand it anymore. The program collapsed. To me that was really transformative b/c it’s not writing the algorithms but how it all works together. Then this taught me how to communicate the design to the other members on the team to make it work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:50 – James: Have you heard of <a href="https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/Rational-Rose"><span class="s5">Rational Rose</span></a>? You don’t hear about it anymore b/c it was a complete flop. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:20 – Chuck: Wow!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:33 – James: It was actually detrimental to get it done. It really was a crisis of faith. I ran into this book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color"><span class="s5">Object Modeling in Color by Peter Coad.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Extreme Programming is mentioned, too, by James’ coworker! </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:10 – Chuck: It’s so interesting to me. We focus so much on the technological side, we forget to talk about the people, and the other sides to this. It’s easy to overlook this other stuff. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:47 – James: There is so much silver bullet thinking within this industry. The original communication from person-to-person is so crucial. It’s so important to software development. Ultimately, the computer doesn’t care, but the collaboration is the real trick and the real challenge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:10 – <i>Chuck talks about his brother and his computer science courses experience.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:27 – James: It could be that 1 team could solve a problem but nowadays it’s working with multiple teams. People want to water things down to help facilitate – but don’t do that. There is a huge large scale Agile that is large interdependent teams. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:19 – Chuck: <a href="https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast"><span class="s5">MFCEO is a podcast</span></a> that I am listening to now. He says that nobody wants to sit down and dictate what each member will be responsible for. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Chuck reads a quote from an episode from </i><a href="https://andyfrisella.com/blogs/mfceo-project-podcast"><span class="s5"><i>MFCEO</i></span></a><i> – check it out!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:54 – James: It’s something that people have lost track of. I still program daily even though I do this Agile stuff as well. I have been programming for 25 years and Extreme Programming was the most effective thing for me throughout my career. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">James: I think XP is the time (now) to have a comeback!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:41 – Chuck: That was my experience, too. We pushed one team to go to Agile, and then we went to our boss. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Chuck: We’d sit down every two weeks and have an Agile-Perspective (what is working and what isn’t working). We are talking about HOW we are writing the software, and that is really what we are after. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:54 – James: You are building the TEAM that builds the project. Of course, you need to have consistencies across the team, and every team is different b/c every member has different personalities. Mod Programming is we are going to work as a whole group around a screen. Personally, that is not my style but I would TRY it. If it worked for that team then I would do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:00 – Chuck: That is the beauty of it. With this set of programmers x, y, and z may or may not work, and that is O.K.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:25 – James: I heard about Extreme Programming and I thought it was nuts!!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:40 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:44 – James: The more I tried it, and the more it worked. Try Extreme Programming b/c it’s totally a different experience. It’s my<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software-ebook/dp/B00F8QCK0E/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=1541462025"><span class="s5"> book</span></a> that I wrote 10 years ago but it still is applicable today. Try it for a few months (3 months) or so, b/c it takes time to figure out the different terms and such. Go try out a bunch of new different things, but figuring out HOW to make it work for me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:05 – Chuck: Yeah, you need data. Look at the data. Go experiment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:47 – James: Try it for real. Check out this essay: “We tried baseball, and it didn’t work.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">James: Many things only work in context!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we do is we change the context in Agile. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:58 – Chuck: What are you working on now?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:00 – James: I am actually working on AgileFluency.org. It’s a set of tools for coaches and leaders to CHANGE their context. How can you find those constraints and invest on changing those. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:31 – Chuck: Where do they go to find you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:40 – James: My website - it’s the ugliest website, but it’s been working since 2003.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:54 – Picks! </span></p>
