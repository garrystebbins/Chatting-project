My Angular Story is celebrating its 100th episode today with hosts Aaron Frost and Charles Max Wood. Charles and Aaron tell their stories of how they got into Angular. They compare React and AngularJS. 

They also talk about the evolution of My Angular Story and how the show helped Charles learn more Angular. My Angular Story paved the way for more other Angular podcasts such as Angular Air. 

Charles and Aaron invite community to tweet to them if they are more agnostic or if they are more framework specific.
