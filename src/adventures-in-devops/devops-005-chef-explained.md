## Episode Summary

This episode of the Adventures in DevOps podcast is all about Chef. Nell Shamrell-Harrington - Principal Engineer at Chef Software is interviewed by panelist Lee Whalen starting with what Chef is and what it is used for.  Nell describes how Chef works with containers, Chef Habitat and how it fits into the overall DevOps culture. Lee asks if it can be used to manage systems with push-pull based configuration management as well. Nell shares how Chef can be advantageous for the higher management and the business as a whole by being automated and high-speed. She compares different configuration management tools and lists certain compromises when using Chef over the others. She explains why they had to apply Apache 2.0 license to the software, but explains that it does not include the code which is totally open source, only the executable build. She mentions some popular Chef code bases that have numerous good contributions from the community. She says that Chef has about 1000 open source projects currently, and appeals to listeners to take a look at the [GitHub book](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/) that they've written containing information about all of those.
