This episode of Adventures in DevOps is joined by John Epperson. John is a developer and has worked in DevOps for his whole career spanning about 12 years. He is also the author of Shiplane. John made Shiplane after working with Docker for a while and getting fed up with some features not being as he wanted them to be. The panelists begin the discussion with going over John’s talk “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”, where he covers three camps of developers namely pioneers, settlers, and townsfolk and the panelists go into detail about these camps. They also talk about how docker and Shiplane fit into this idea. 

John shares that Shiplane is a tool that converts docker-compose yaml files into production-ready docker deployments. John details more of how shiplane came about, the problems it solves, how it works, and how it helps users to cross knowledge barriers. He also shares how Shiplane provides customizability as it will give the user everything they need but lets them choose the pieces they want. The panelists also discuss what websites are running Shiplane as well as some of the support that Shiplane has. Currently it does not support Kubernetes but John is working on it. Chuck then asks John what the use case is for running Shiplane. They discuss specifically whether Shiplane is used locally, or as a SAAS service and why it is the way it is. 

Nell then asks John what his hopes are for the future of Shiplane. John would like to have Kubernetes capability added within a year. If someone wants to get involved with Shiplane they can do so by trying it out, reaching out to him on his discord server, and helping him find edge cases.
