1:49 – Chuck: Why are you famous?

1:57 – Guest’s background.

4:35 – Chuck: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) – Anyone play with this?

4:49 – Panelist: Yes. Funny situation, I was working with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/languages). [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/languages) is very costly, but great.

_The story continues..._

6:13 – Panelist: I was so overwhelmed with how difficult it was to launch a simple website. Now, that being said we were using the [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), which is the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). They don’t have nearly as much good tools, but that’s my experience.

6:48 – Chuck: I haven’t tried [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

8:58 – Rahul: I would like to add a few comments. Managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) service is not a big deal at the moment, but...

11:19 – Panelist: You wouldn’t recommend people using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) unless they were well versed? What is that term?

11:40 – Rahul: Not anyone could use the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster. Let’s offer that complexity to another company that can handle and mange it.

13:02 – The guest continues this conversation.

14:02 – Panelist: I didn’t know that [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) needed different nodes.

14:28 – Rahul continues this topic.

15:05 – What hardware requirements do they need?

15:19 – Rahul: Yes, they do need a good system. Good amount of memory. Good network space.

15:45 – Panelist asks Rahul a question.&nbsp;

16:30 – Rahul: Let’s answer this into two parts.

[_Kubernetes_](https://kubernetes.io) _topic is being discussed in detail._

18:41 – Chuck adds comments and asks a question.

18:58 – Rahul talks about companies and programs. Check out this timestamp to hear his thoughts.

20:42 – Another company is mentioned added to this conversation.

21:55 – Additional companies mentioned: Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc. (Rahul)

22:14 – Chuck: It’s interesting how much community plays a role into success stories. Whether or not it’s best technologies it comes down to where there are enough people to help me if I don’t know what to do.

22:43 – Rahul: People, even enterprises, are there.

23:15 – Chuck: At what point (let’s say I docked my app) should they be looking at [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)? Are you waiting on traffic? How do you make that call?

23:56 – Rahul answers the questions.

26:29 – Rahul: If your application is...

27:13 – [Announcement – Digital Ocean!](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

27:51 – Chuck: How does someone get started with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)?

27:53 – Rahul answers the question.

30:00 – Chuck: It sounds like you have an amateur setup – Dave?

30:21 – Dave: I think the problem is that there is not a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for dummies blog post. There has always been some sort of “gottcha!” As much as these documents say that there are solutions here and there, but you will see that there are networking issues. Once you get that up and running, then there are more issues at hand. The other strange thing is that once everything seems to be working okay, and then I started getting connectivity issues. It’s definitely not an afternoon project. It takes researching and googling. At the end, it takes a direction at large that the community is investing into.

32:58 – Chuck makes additional comments.

33:21 – Dave adds more comments. Sorry bad joke – Dave.

33:40 – Topic – Virtualization.

34:32 – Having Swamp is a good idea.

34:44 – Rahul adds his comments.

36:54 – Panelist talks about virtualization and scaling.

37:45 – Rahul adds in comments about the ecosystems.

38:21 – Panelist talks about server-less functions.&nbsp;

39:11 – Rahul: Not every application can...

40:32 – Panelist: I guess the whole downside to...

41:07 – Rahul talks about this.

43:03 – Chuck to Eric: Any problems with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for you?

43:05 – Eric: Yes – just spelling it! For me it feels like you are in a jet with all of these different buttons. There are 2 different types of developers. I am of DevOps-minded. That’s why we are getting solutions, and tools like Heroku to help. When I listen to this conversation, I feel quiet only because you guys are talking about spiders and I’m afraid of spiders.

44:44 – Dave to Eric: Having information and knowledge about [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) will help you as a developer. Having some awareness can really help you as a developer.

45:43 – Chuck: There are all these options to know about it – they way he is talking about it sounds like it’s the person on the jet. Don’t touch the red button and don’t’ cut the wrong wire! It feels like with software – it’s a beautiful thing – you erase it and reinstall it!

46:50 – Dave: What? What are all of these crazy words?! What does this exactly mean? The visibility is definitely not there for someone who is just tinkering with it.

47:16 – Rahul: It’s not for someone who is tinkering with it. Definitely.

50:02 – Chuck: We have been talking about benefits of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) – great. What kinds of processes to setup with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) to make your life easier?

50:40 Rahul answers the question.
