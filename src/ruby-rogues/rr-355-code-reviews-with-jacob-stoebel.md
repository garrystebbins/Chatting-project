 **Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Jacob Stoebel

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel discusses code reviews with Jacob Stoebel. Jacob is a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) developer and works for [ePublishing](https://www.epublishing.com/) where he does mostly front-end programming. He talks about how he believes that code reviews can be both honest and nice, and that they should inspire the programmer to want to go back and make his/her code better, not tear him/her down. He also gives fours steps to the response process for giving positive and helpful code reviews.
