### **Episode Summary**
Kurtis has been working with Ruby and open source for 12 years. These days he works on maintaining large libraries like VCR. He talks about what VCR is, why it’s useful, and some of its limitations. The real topic of today’s show is Kubernetes. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. Kurtis describes what it is and some of the features it has.The panel discuss about some of the limitations of Kubernetes, and where it really shines in the development lifecycle. Kurtis advises Kubernete users to leave their databases as an outside source and not put them in Kubernetes, as well as other things to avoid. They talk about methods for encrypting information within Kubernetes. The panel discusses how Kubernetes compares to other services and some of the unique features.The panel discusses what it’s like to learn Kubernetes. Kurtis advises listeners who are learning Kubernetes to consult with other people who are experienced with. Kubernetes has some different terms for functions that can be confusing to newcomers. It can take between 3 and 6 complete weekends to become comfortable using Kubernetes. Kurtis shares how to transfer a Rails app into Kubernetes. To get started with Kubernetes on the cheap, find a computer with a decent amount of ram, install Ubuntu and MicroK8s for a perfect tinkering playground. **Links**
