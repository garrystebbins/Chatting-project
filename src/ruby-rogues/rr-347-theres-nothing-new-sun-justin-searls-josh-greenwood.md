 **Panel:** Dave Kimura Eric Berry David Richards **Special Guest: Justin Searls and Josh Greenwood** In this episode, the Ruby Rogues speaks with Justin Searls and Josh Greenwood. Justin and Josh both work for a software agency called [Test Double](http://testdouble.com), who are a fully remote software agency. Both Josh and Justin are well versed in many technologies and platforms of development such as Ruby, Javascript and much more.&nbsp; Both Justin and Josh are on the show to talks about their recent presentation “There's Nothing New Under the Sun,” which was presented at conferences. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
- History and the knowledge of the community
- Abandoning Gems
- Exploratory
- The rise of Rails
- How much of what you do is in Ruby and Rails?
- New contracts - How long do they last?
- Secrets to onboard members or developers?
- Overwhelmed with projects?
- Where do you see Ruby in the next few years?
- Slowing of processors - Intel
- Working with other languages, then into Ruby
- Jim!
- Our industry’s obsession at placing novelty/newness above deeper truths and wisdoms. Once the shine has worn off we tend to ignore it, and even the timeline-style most information consumption software is designed with goes out of its way to bury anything “old”
- What important context new Ruby developers tend to lack (this was the motivation for the talk in the first place) and what can we do to make them more comfortable & capable
- Straight up nostalgia time. Folks who’ve been in Ruby for a while should find motivation and encouragement by celebrating our past more often to remind ourselves of why we love Ruby
- and much much more.
