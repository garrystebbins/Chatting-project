Our small Ruby podcast has been overrun by the likes of Josh Susser, who this month chose [Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013476904X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=013476904X) ![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=013476904X&camp=217145&creative=399369) by Kent Beck as our Book Club for next month. We'll be recording the podcast on Tuesday, October 4th at 9:30AM Mountain Time.

### Kent will be joining us for that episode.

If you have questions you'd like to ask Kent or comments about the book, leave a comment and we'll cover it during the show.
