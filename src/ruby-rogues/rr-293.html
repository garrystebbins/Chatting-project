<h2><b>RR 293 Packaging Ruby with Nell Shamrell-Harrington</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On today’s episode, Charles Max Wood and Jerome Hardaway discuss </span><b>Packaging Ruby with Nell Shamrell-Harrington</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nell is an expert Software Development Engineer at Chef Software. Tune in to learn how you can provide viable packaging solutions!</span>
<h2><b>Packaging Ruby</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nell used to host applications on cloud providers. People get to use those apps only when they visit their website. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When she worked for Chef, however, she created software that people can run on their own hardware. That’s what packaging means to her—making an artifact or gem that someone can use on their own workstations. An example is Ruby Gems, self-contained programs which anyone with a Ruby can install and run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Check Episode 291 for more information on Ruby Gems.</span>
<h2><b>Concerns on Security</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing who and where the package is from is also something to consider when purchasing software. Nell brings up certain concerns with regards to packaging and downloading them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this, Charles recalls his previous work experience at Public Engines. He used to work with government data and had certain restrictions in dealing with them. It made him wary of security issues later on.</span>
<h2><b>Perfect Packaging Solution</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There can be a number of reasons for packaging applications in a specific way. It varies depending on the server and type of environment. Nell identifies this with her experience at Chef.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of their customers worked in air-gapped environments. Their hardware is secured from outside internet connection. To provide viable solutions for them, Chef needs to tailor fit a package that would suit the type of environment they’re in.</span>
