Do you know someone who is? We want to hear from you! We, the Ruby Rogues, are planning an episode all about what it’s like to be a Ruby Nuby in 2012. We want to talk to some actual Nubies. And we need your help finding them. Want to help? Good! Here’s how:
<ol>
 	<li>First, look in the mirror. Did you find a Nuby? Great! Proceed to step #3. Otherwise...</li>
 	<li>Find a Nuby! She or he might be someone you’re helping learn Ruby, someone in your local Ruby User Group or meetup, or even someone you know online.</li>
 	<li>Got/are a Nuby? OK now for the fun part! Have your Nuby record a 5 minute video talking about their experience learning Ruby. They should answer these questions:
<ul>
 	<li>Who are you?</li>
 	<li>What do you use Ruby for?</li>
 	<li>How have you gone about learning the language? What resources did you use? E.g. books, videos, blog posts, online courses, one-on-one tutoring, etc.</li>
 	<li>What has been the most difficult, surprising and/or delightful aspect of learning Ruby?</li>
 	<li>What do you appreciate most about the Ruby community?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Upload the video to YouTube. Tag it RubyNuby.</li>
 	<li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:rubynuby@rubyrogues.com" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:rubynuby@rubyrogues.com">rubynuby@rubyrogues.com</a> with a link to your video. (Feel free to post a comment with the link here as well, but we need the email to track things.)</li>
</ol>
<div>All participants who submit a video will receive not one, not zero, but <strong>THREE</strong> great incentives! Every participant will get:</div>
<ul>
 	<li>A free 1-month subscription to Ryan Bates' <a href="http://railscasts.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts.com</a> pro screencasts.</li>
