**Panel:**

- Dave Kimura
- Eric Berry

**Special Guests:** Luke Francl

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel talks to Luke Francl about his article “[Upgrading Rails applications incrementally](https://www.recursion.org/incremental-rails-upgrade/)”. Luke works at GitHub on search and has been there since October 2017. Before working at [GitHub](https://github.com/), he worked at a search startup that was working with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). They talk about things that people take for granted with search, the impending takeover of GitHub from Microsoft, and what open source looks like today. They also touch on the process of getting hired at GitHub, his process for upgrading Rails applications, and more!
