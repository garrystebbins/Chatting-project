**Panel:** Charles Max Wood Eric Berry **Special Guest:&nbsp;** Justin Weiss In this episode, the Ruby Rouges speak with [Justin Weiss](https://github.com/justinweiss). Justin is a software developer for [aha.io](https://aha.io), blogs at [justinweiss.com](https://justinweiss.com), and is also the book author of [Practicing Rails: Learn Rails without being overwhelmed](https://www.justinweiss.com/practicing-rails/). Justin gives a preview of his presentation at [Ruby Dev Summit](https://rubydevsummit.com), which is about exploring connections between your apps and the web. Ruby Rogues and Justin dive deep into questions about testing apps with an array of tools to see how that information is relevant in exploring connectivity and working parts of apps. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Apps becoming of the web instead of running on the web
- Breaking into the connection between your apps or native client and your mode APIs
- Micro Services
- Finding the pain points
- Where to start to begin open visibility
- Deploy and looking at logs - Gems and Libraries.
- Tooling - API requests manually - [Postman app](https://postman%20application/json), [PAW](https://paw.cloud)
- Automation or one-off tools
- When something breaks, what kind of information is relevant
- Figuring out what part of the apps are working well and reproducing problems
- Error Logs
- [Sandi Metz Principle](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)
- Authentication and Authorization
- Characterizing
- and much much more.
