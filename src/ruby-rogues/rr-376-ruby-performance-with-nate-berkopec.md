**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Eric Berry
- David Richards
  **Special Guests:** Nate Berkopec

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel talks to Nate Berkopec about Ruby Performance. Nate is a freelance [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) performance consultant and he writes and works on Ruby application performance, specifically [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) applications, which he has been doing for the past 3 or 4 years. They talk about his past experience, what led him to Ruby performance, and why he loves [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks). They also touch on the two benefits to performance work, if Ruby performance on the back-end really matters for the majority of cases, and more!
