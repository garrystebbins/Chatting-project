**Special Guests:** Daniel P. Clark

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panelists talk to Daniel P. Clark about improving Ruby performance with Rust. Daniel has been a hobbyist programmer for over 20 years and started blogging about [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and other technical matters about 5 years ago. One of the things he is well known for is his [Faster Path](https://github.com/danielpclark/faster_path) gem on GitHub, which has over 700 stars. They talk about his blog article [_Improving Ruby Performance with Rust_](https://blog.codeship.com/improving-ruby-performance-with-rust/), why he chose to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), and the benefits of using a Rust extension in Ruby. They also touch on his faster path gem, the [Helix](https://usehelix.com/) project, and more!
