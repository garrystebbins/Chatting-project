 **Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Eric Berry
- **Special Guests:** Daniel Azuma and Tee Parham

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel discusses geospatial programming with Daniel Azuma and Tee Parham. Daniel is a developer at Google and has been doing [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for about 14 years. Tee is co-founder and CTO of [Neighborland](https://neighborland.com/), which is built on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). Before that, he founded, managed and led technical projects for a small startup for about 8 years. They discuss what geospatial programming is, what [RGeo Gem](https://github.com/rgeo/rgeo) is, and other interesting aspects of geospatial programming.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Daniel and Tee intros

- Draw shapes on a map to outline the cities or space
- A lot goes into Geospatial programming
- What drove you to create this project?
- Why [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)?
