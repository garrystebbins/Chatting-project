<p class="p1"><span class="s3">In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel talks to <a href="https://github.com/saveriomiroddi"><span class="s4">Saverio Miroddi</span></a> who is an engineer among other things. Saverio has written articles, and a link to two of his articles is found below. The panel and Saverio talk about Ruby, Ruby Motion, Shoes, Hackety Hack, and much more! Check out the episode! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:05 – Chuck asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:42 – Chuck: What do you recommend for the listeners?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:49 – Saverio: At the time I recommended an underdog. Now, making a recommendation is kind of hard. It depends on what they need. It’s fascinating in a way, because web development is not straightforward. Through the choice the subject is so wide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:58 – Panelist: Building desktop applications the very last thin I think: I should build this in Ruby. It sounds like I am not the only person. Why would people want to build desktop apps in Ruby versus another program? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:38 – Chuck: I was thinking the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:59 – Saverio: Personally, I like consistency. When Ruby came out it’s meant to be very easy. It should be easy to hack a certain tool. It depends on a case basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:15 – Panelist: How does Ruby shine in this respect?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:19 – Saverio: It’s hard to say. It is a compromise with everything. That’s the case – if it is meant to be simple, keep it simple. When I wrote my app I was looking for consistency. Ruby is far from ideal and it’s compromising the project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:02 – Panelist: Tell us how you use it? Tell us your cases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:17 – Saverio dives into this topic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:05 – Panelist: I hate web applications online – I want it on my desktop. But it’s funny; I am the opposite when I make it. I really like the idea of Ruby being expanded beyond web application. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Panelist continues to talk about what/where/how Ruby is used or not used. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:30 – Chuck: I like the idea of expanding to other areas, as well. Do you think there is enough momentum to get it to a new place? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:09 – Saverio answers this question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Saverio: To be honest, this might just be a niche. It’s being developed at a slow pace. I know a few things use Ruby, and they just want to use a few small tools, and a few frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:38 – Panelist talks about Ruby and how it can be good for kids and beginners because of the visual component/feedback. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:49 – Saverio: I agree.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:59 – Chuck: I asked earlier, what would you recommend to kids to get started?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:20 – Saverio answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:02 – Panelist: I think I have a compromise, what about a web application that loads like a regular web page, but also has offline functionality? If you go offline it can load and sometimes work. Now you have a native application. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:47 – Chuck adds in a comment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">16:53 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s4">Advertisement</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:31 – Saverio: That would be complex, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:44 – Chuck: They were headed towards desktop but never got there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:55 – Panelist: There is <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com"><span class="s4">Ruby Motion.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:41 – Chuck: We are going to have a special guest back to talk about doing <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com"><span class="s4">Ruby Motion</span></a> on the Nintendo Switch. I think it will take a lot to compile to get to the new system.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:07 – What is your experience with building Opal?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:17 – Saverio: I excluded those, actually. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:50 – Panelist: Let’s talk about data and storing data? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:04 – Saverio: Definitely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><i>Saverio dives into this topic...</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:28 – Chuck: Do you use Active Record?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:32 – Saverio: No.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:00 – Saverio: I like simplistic solutions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:19 – Chuck: That sounds like it wouldn’t be completely foreign for people who have done web development. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">If we are more web active what will throw us off? Just in general. Your visual is different than the web. It’s different between a desktop and a web app. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:21 – Panelist: If you are building in Ruby it can be locked down to a single thread.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:37 – Saverio adds his thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:59 – Panelist: Any open source projects that are gooey based application?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:25 – Saverio: I am not aware. There are applications out there that are getting traction, though. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:50 – Chuck asks Saverio a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:01 – Saverio talks about Ruby </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:12 – Saverio is deciding on whether or not to transition to another language or not.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">26:36 – Chuck: Things that are built with <a href="http://shoesrb.com"><span class="s4">Shoes</span></a>...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackety_Hack"><span class="s4">Hackety Hack</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">26:55 – Saverio: It is hard to write in Shoes. It’s fun for the beginner. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">27:34 – Chuck: Anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">27:41 – Panelist: This has to do with the Gooey, and it’s Native Fire. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">29:05 – Chuck chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">29:26 – Panelist continues talking about this topic. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">30:48 – Panelist: To make it beyond a toy, there needs to be more community support and more examples. I have been in Ruby for a while, but building applications in React and Electron is not that simple as in Ruby. I hope to see more support in open-source projects, and to take it to the next level. This is a story yet to be told.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">31:52 – Panelist: My concern is it always looks like a high school project.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">32:15 – Chuck: Yeah, doesn’t look completely polished. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">32:19 – Saverio: Yes, when you go to a Ruby talk then...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">32:50 – Chuck: Anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">33:04 – Saverio: I have nothing else to add.</span></p>
