 **Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Dan Manges

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel talks to Dan Manges about his blog post entitled [_The Modular Monolith: Rails Architecture_](https://medium.com/@dan_manges/the-modular-monolith-rails-architecture-fb1023826fc4). Dan is the CTO of [Root](https://www.joinroot.com/?utm_expid=.fdeJJszjRUq24CtIqQhOyw.0&utm_referrer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.dan-manges.com%252F), which is a car insurance carrier in Columbus, Ohio. They started the company a few years ago because they felt that the prices people pay for car insurance should be based primarily on diving behavior and not demographics. They talk about how he built the architecture of the app for his company, what a Modular Monolith is, their different gems, and more!
