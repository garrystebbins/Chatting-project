### Episode summary
Stefan Wintermeyer, a german consultant, discusses his recent blog post “Rails needs Active Deployment”. He goes on to explain that this isn’t meant for rails deployment “rockstars” or Heroku, this is for normal developers who need an easier way to deploy their rails applications. Stefan Wintermeyer addresses the suggestions of using Docker. This begins a discussion of the different services that can be used and the disconnects found in many of them. Stefan Wintermeyer brings up the unfortunate truth of how many new developers give up because of the difficulty of the last step in rails. The panel discusses the difficulty of finding a perfect fit for all applications and share the different solutions they’ve tried in many services. This sparks a lively discussion on what a community wide solution might look like and what that might entail.
