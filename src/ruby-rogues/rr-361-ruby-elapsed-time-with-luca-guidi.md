**Special Guests:** Luca Guidi

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panelists talk to Luca Guidi about Ruby elapsed time. Luca works remotely for [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/) and is most well known in the[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) community for his open source projects, such as [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/).
