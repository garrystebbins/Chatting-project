# GIVE US YOUR NUBIES!
 ![IFrame](https://admin.devchat.tv/assets/ckeditor/plugins/fakeobjects/images/spacer-9f991de5fc84b2a293830f22f0b3d718.gif "IFrame")Are you a Ruby Nuby? Do you know someone who is? We want to hear from you! We, the Ruby Rogues, are planning an episode all about what it’s like to be a Ruby&nbsp;Nuby in 2012. We want to talk to some actual Nubies. And we need your help finding them. Want to help? Good! Here’s how:
1. First, look in the mirror. Did you find a Nuby? Great! Proceed to step #3. Otherwise...
2. Find a Nuby! She or he might be someone you’re helping learn Ruby, someone in your local Ruby User Group or meetup, or even someone you know online.
3. Got/are a Nuby? OK now for the fun part! Have your&nbsp;Nuby record a 5 minute video talking about their experience learning Ruby. They should answer these questions:
  - Who are you?
  - What do you use Ruby for?
  - How have you gone about learning the language? What resources did you use? E.g. books, videos, blog posts, online courses, one-on-one tutoring, etc.
  - What has been the most difficult, surprising and/or delightful aspect of learning Ruby?
  - What do you appreciate most about the Ruby community?
4. Upload the video to YouTube. Tag it RubyNuby.
5. Send an email to [rubynuby@rubyrogues.com](mailto:rubynuby@rubyrogues.com) with a link to your video. (Feel free to post a comment with the link here as well, but we need the email to track things.)

All participants who submit a video will receive not one, not zero, but **THREE** great incentives! Every participant will get:

- A free 1-month subscription to Ryan Bates' [RailsCasts.com](http://railscasts.com/) pro screencasts.
- A free 1-month subscription to the [RubyMonk.com](http://rubymonk.com/) Ruby learning site.
- 20% off [The Pragmatic Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/)'s [Ruby online training course](http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby).
Big thanks to [RailsCasts.com](http://railscasts.com/), [RubyMonk.com](http://rubymonk.com/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[The Pragmatic&nbsp;Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/)&nbsp;for their generous support! Submissions are due by 10/31/12. We’ll review the videos, and invite a couple of the&nbsp;Nubies with the best hair with **the most awesome hat** who match our top-secret Roguish Nuby-selection process onto the show to share their experiences with the Ruby Rogues audience!
