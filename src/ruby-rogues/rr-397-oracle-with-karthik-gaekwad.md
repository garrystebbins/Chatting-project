Special Guest: Karthik Gaekwad **Episode Summary** In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panelists speak with Karthik Gaekwad, who helped build the Oracle Kubernetes Engine. The panelists discuss the naming of Ruby as the Server-Side Programming Language of the Year in 2018, beating out PHP and Java. Karthik talks about incorporating Ruby into Oracle. His team uses Ruby in both development and operations, and having a common language has increased their efficiency. The panelists discuss the shift from constant servers to more volatile servers that can make provisions on the fly. Karthik explains the benefits of using Oracle Cloud Native over other services. Oracle places a lot of emphasis on helping startups by giving them more computing power than other companies. Karthik talks about the merits of using Kubernetes in testing and production, and encourages those interested in using Kubernetes to jump in and start learning about it. For startups that want to use Kubernetes but lack a specialist, Karthik suggests letting a cloud service (like Oracle) manage the servers. Finally, Karthik tells listeners how to get started using Oracle Cloud, namely: 
1. Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com/home)
2. Click the green “Try For Free” button to create your account
3. Go into the Oracle Cloud Console and start exploring
4. People who sign up get $300 in free credits
