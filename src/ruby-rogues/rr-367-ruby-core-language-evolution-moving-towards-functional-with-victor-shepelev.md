**Special Guests:** Victor Shepelev

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panelists talk to Victor Shepelev about functional programming in Ruby. Victor is a Ukrainian programmer and poet who has been programming since he was a child. He has been programming with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for the past 12 years and has contributed a lot to the open source community, as well as mentors and participates in discussions about Ruby’s progress. They talk about how to approach functional programming in Ruby, changes Victor hopes to see in Ruby, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Victor intro

- Used to be a computer journalist and historian of programming languages
- Higher-order functions
- Functional style of programming was possible from the beginning in Ruby
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- Functional style in any language
- Making the functional style more natural in the future 
- His current interests 
- Is pattern matching something you would like to see changed?
- What are some changes in Ruby that you would like to see?
- What is pattern-matching?
- Seeing code in a more idiomatic way
- Still a lot of discussions happening
- Immutable objects 
- Speeding up Ruby
- The more functional Ruby is becoming, the more room for optimization there is
- Writing at a higher level
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

- The “old self”
- And much, much more!
