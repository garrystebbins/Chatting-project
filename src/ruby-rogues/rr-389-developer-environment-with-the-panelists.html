<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:03 – David: Welcome! Today, Chuck is not feeling well. I am David and today we have Eric Berry on our panel today. It is just the two of us today. I want to talk about our development environment. What is your setup like? Do you have an office space and your hardware?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:58 – Eric: I Have a room in my basement that has everything that I need. I do work from home. There is my guitar, my geek toys and more. For my hardware I am using 2017 MacBook Pro (16 GB of ram). The 13-inch is convenient, but I upgraded b/c I do a lot of traveling. I do pull the iPad out and use <a href="https://www.duetdisplay.com"><span class="s3">DUET</span></a>. You no longer have to use a cord. I have a monitor that is 30-inches and it’s gorgeous. That is my hardware setup. I am not a mechanical keyboard guy, and I stick with the Apple super flat keyboard. I do use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bestand-Trackpad-MJ2R2LL-Keyboard-Included/dp/B07F6WXSWT"><span class="s3">Bestand</span></a> – it’s a holster for the keyboard and the track pad. What do you have?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:35 – David: I have a Frankenstein setup. My needs change, over time, and when that changes my hardware changes. Back in the day I did not have a Mac and I used a Windows machine. I used to be a gamer, but then met my wife and then stopped b/c she didn’t like for me to waste time. My setup is more proper. I have a baseline iMac Pro b/c there was a great deal of $1,000 off. The other option was an iMac. I like the desktop b/c that’s where I do work – at home. It was a $4,000 investment. I am on my computer ALL the time it was worth it to me. I got the wall-mount for me, and I have more monitors wall-mounted, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:00 – David: That is my monitor and computer setup. I have an eco-rhythmic keyboard b/c of childhood injuries. I have a really old Microsoft keyboard from 2005 something. It was cheap but I like the style of it. For my mouse I have a Logitech mouse. I love the feel of this thing. It has a side scroll left and right, and up and down. Especially when I am looking at code. It helps with my video editing, too. My mouse is my favorite to-date. I don’t have too much plugged into the Mac. I have a <a href="https://www.goanywhere.com/managed-file-transfer/collaboration/godrive"><span class="s3">GoDrive</span></a>, which has everything on it – my whole life’s work is on there. If there is ever an emergency I know to grab that. Back things up in case of an emergency would be my tips to you all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:40 – Eric: I have struggled with backing things up actually. The problem that I have is that I am constantly moving my laptop. I have this guilt and fear of doing it wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:33 – David: I have this work laptop – I don’t back that up every day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>David gives Eric his suggestions in regards to backing files up. David mentions </i><a href="https://www.backblaze.com"><span class="s3"><i>Back Blaze.</i></span></a><i> </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:05 – Eric: That makes sense. I live in the Apple eco-system. I have my phone, watch, 40 iPads, laptop – everything backs up to the Cloud. The date we are recording this is 10/30/18. Apple just announced a new upgrade. I feel like this could compete with an actual laptop computer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Eric asks David a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:35 – David: ...My main problem with that is that you might already have a developmental machine. It’s a stationary computer then it’s not feasible to take on the go. I do have an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/?afid=p238%257Cs4jbd50ah-dc_mtid_2092592t39165_pcrid_307875917033_&amp;cid=wwa-us-kwgo-ipad-slid--"><span class="s3">iPad Pro</span></a> and I will take that on the go. I can login to my home network.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">BLINK – I used on my <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/?afid=p238%257Cs4jbd50ah-dc_mtid_2092592t39165_pcrid_307875917033_&amp;cid=wwa-us-kwgo-ipad-slid--"><span class="s3">iPad Pro.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>David continues to talk about his setup.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:00 – Eric: I kind of agree with you. I have seen it used quite a bit. My brother does everything online for his job. The pros are that if you are training, and his company is configured that way. The pros is that you can code from anywhere on anyone’s computer. I am glad that it DOES exist. It’s not Cloud9 but someone does offer...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:20 – David: I think going to a solo screen does hurt my productivity – working on the iPad vs. working on the computer. I could get faster and faster but only to a certain degree. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">If you have the resources – then I don’t think it’s sustainable. However, if you don’t have the resources it’s better than nothing. At least you are coding and that’s important. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:15 – Eric: I think of the audience we cater to with Ruby Rogues. I wonder if our listeners are strapped for cash or if they do have the resources to get the job done?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:48 – David: If you don’t have a lot of money, you don’t have to buy a Mac. If Cloud hosting isn’t your thing there are different options. You have DOCKER, and use Windows as your main editor, and the WSL. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I wanted to do a test – I bout a laptop for $500-$700 and you can get away with doing what you need to do. Learning how to program and code with what you have is great!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">25:00 </span><span class="s5">– <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com"><span class="s3">Advertisement – Fresh Books!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">26:05 – Eric: Let’s talk about the software developer environment. Nate Hopkins isn’t on today, but you can’t change his mind – I am VEM all the way. I think Cuck is <a href="https://emaxsoftware.com"><span class="s3">EMAX.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">26:43 – Eric: What do you do?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">26:45 – David: I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><span class="s3">VS code.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><i>David talks about the benefits of using </i><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><span class="s3"><i>VS code.</i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">27:37 – Eric: Yes, 100%. I met the lead engineer behind <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><span class="s3">VS code.</span></a> They just made a new announcement. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I have been using VS code for quite a while now. The integrated terminal and other features are awesome. Pulling me out of <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com"><span class="s3">Sublime Text</span></a> was a really, really hard thing for me. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">29:28 – David: Sublime text, yes, but I got tired of the 40-year long beta, and the lack of expanding it, too. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"><span class="s3">VS code</span></a> has won my heart over. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">30:53 – Eric: My guess is that they are going to leave it alone. I am sure they will connect the 2 teams. Think of how much work has gone into <a href="https://atom.io"><span class="s3">ATOM.</span></a> That would be a hard pill to swallow.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">31:20 – David: At the end of the day, though, it is a company. You don’t need 2 different editors when they do the same thing. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">31:40 – Eric: I would have to disagree with you. Maybe they won’t merge the 2 but they just become different between <a href="https://atom.io"><span class="s3">ATOM</span></a> (<a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s3">React</span></a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"><span class="s3">React Native</span></a>) and...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">32:22 – David: Why would a company cancel something only have 1 season? (Clears throat...Fox!) </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">32:58 – Eric: I open very large files with Sublime. Sublime handles this very easily. This goes back to: why am I opening up very large files?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">33:31 – David: It’s a log file don’t lie.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">33:40 – David: What browser do you use? Safari?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">34:03 – Eric: Safari is nice for non-developers. Safari is lightweight and very fast. I have been a browser whore. I go from bedroom to bedroom from Opera to Firefox to Chrome. I fall into the Chrome field though. I have a problem with Chrome, though, and that it knows me too well. Google can sell my data and they do. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">37:14 – David: With <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s3">BRAVE,</span></a> weren’t they doing something with the block chain and bit coin to reward you for browsing? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">37:38 – Eric: Yeah I think that’s being run by...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">38:03 – David: I still use CHROME b/c I like the extensions. It’s important to know why you are picking a certain browser. When you are talking about development you need to know who your target audience is. What kind of apps do you use? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">39:54 – Eric: It’s interesting to see how much traffic the Android Browser gets. You want to switch over to other parts? For my tech software...I use <a href="https://polymail.io"><span class="s3">Polymail.io</span></a> for email. I use THINGS to keep me on-track, I use SLACK, BRAVE BROSWER, iTerm3 and MERT. I use FANTASTICO (calendar), and I use BEAR (for my note taking). What about you?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">41:21 – David: I use <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html"><span class="s3">iTerm3</span></a>, too. I’m on 3 different Slack channels. I have been using <a href="https://discordapp.com"><span class="s3">DISCORD</span></a>. Other tools that I use are SPECTACLE (extension) among others. I try to keep it slim and simple, though. Another one is <a href="https://www.easy-rez.com"><span class="s3">EasyRez</span></a> (free download) and you can adjust the screen resolution on your desktop monitors. It’s important to target my audience better. I do like PARALLELS, too. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">44:24 – David continues: Screenflow, Apple Motion, and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoJmz46Df3gIVibbACh1r0QOXEAAYASAAEgIX9vD_BwE&amp;sdid=KKQOW&amp;kw=semgeneric&amp;mv=search&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIoJmz46Df3gIVibbACh1r0QOXEAAYASAAEgIX9vD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!301433690360!e!!g!!adobe%2520after%2520affects"><span class="s3">Adobe After Effects CC.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">45:04 – Eric: I use <a href="https://1password.com"><span class="s3">1 PASSWORD</span></a> and BETA BASE. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">46:04 – David: Have you heard of <a href="https://www.lastpass.com"><span class="s3">Last Pass?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">46:15 – Eric: Oh sure! I have been using though 1 Password and I guess there some loyalty there. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">46:54 – <i>David asks Eric a question about </i><a href="https://1password.com"><span class="s3"><i>1 Password</i></span></a><i> about pricing.</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">47:12 – Eric: I want to pay with money than with something else. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">47:23 – David: It’s owned by <a href="https://www.logmein.com/pro/lp/sem-vert?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=lmi-semivert&amp;mcomb=swDRAeh48%257C305846519682%257Clogmein%257Ce%257Ci8rbbhb5l0%257Cc%257C9259893037%257Ckwd-370197516%257C&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=%257BCampaignName%257D&amp;Matchtype=e&amp;adgroupid=9259893037&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrZ7emKDf3gIVybrACh3jvQUbEAAYASAAEgJ0U_D_BwE"><span class="s3">LogMeIn</span></a>, and they have tons of experience with security. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">48:00 – Eric: I am going to put an article here that compares all these different apps so you can see the similarities and differences side-by-side. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">48:40 – David: Anything else? Banking passwords?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">48:54 – Eric: Nah, I am excited to see where we are. I like <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave/"><span class="s3">Mojave</span></a> for the desktop but I don’t like it for the constant number of resets that I’ve had to do. I love what I do.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">49:34 – David: Yeah, I agree. I haven’t experienced any major setbacks, yet. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">49:55 – Picks! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">50:03 – Eric: I think this whole episode has been PICKS! </span></p>
