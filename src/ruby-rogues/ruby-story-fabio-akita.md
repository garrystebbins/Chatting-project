## My&nbsp;Ruby Story Fabio Akita

Tune in as&nbsp;Charles Max Wood interviews&nbsp; **Fabio Akita**!&nbsp;Fabio has been working on Ruby for more than 10 years. He also blogs about it, and participates in Ruby Conf and in the programming community in Brazil. He appeared on [episode 285](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/285-rr-ruby-conf-brazil-and-building-communities-with-fabio-akita), where talked about the conference and the community. Learn more about his journey and contributions in programming.

## Programming in Brazil

Fabio hails from the country of Brazil. He started programming in the late 80s. Finding the materials and references to study was not easy that time because of the import ban on technology.

> “The whole idea of being able to control a machine was interesting.” -Fabio Akita

He was just a kid that time, and enjoyed the sense of control that programming gave him. His uncle introduced him to other legacy tools. That introduced him to doing small business programs. Growing up, Akita found it natural to consume more of programming. By the time he reached college, he decided to take a programming course.

## An Era of New Beginnings

The year 1995 was pretty interesting. Windows 95 was just releasing, and the web was just starting. Akita saw the the rise of Java 1.0 and of other things that are still being used today. The .com era was also just starting that time. He found the new things exciting but also confusing.

## Introduction to Ruby

Akita was already almost 20 years in programming when he got into Ruby. He used to work in the corporate world. From 2002 to 2006, he did SAP consultancy and worked on Apex and Cobol programming languages. The projects he had were very convoluted. He was in the conference in Brazil when Rails came up in 2005. He saw how very different it was in contrast to what he used to work on. To hear the rest of _My Ruby Story Fabio Akita_, download and listen&nbsp;to the entire episode.
