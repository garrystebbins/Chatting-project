**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- David Richards

**Special Guests:** Aaron Sumner

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel discusses removing business logic from Rails controllers with Aaron Sumner. Aaron is a long time Ruby developer, using mostly [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), writes a blog called [Everyday Rails](https://everydayrails.com/), and most people know him from his book, [_Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec: A practical approach to test-driven development_](https://www.amazon.com/Everyday-Rails-Testing-RSpec-test-driven-ebook/dp/B077S8QCG2)_._ They discuss service objects, the pros and cons of using them, and they emphasize not trying to change something all at once, but gradually.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Aaron intro

- The cons to controller tests
- Soft deprecation
- If youâ€™re not writing controller tests, what are you writing?
- Get the code out of the controllers and test it in more isolation
- Service objects
- Problem with a controller having a lot of business logic in it
- [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- Cons of service objects
- Using a service object inside of a controller
- Pros of service objects
- Getting smaller can happen step-wise
- Re-architecting should happen gradually not all at once
- When you write a service object, there is a flow to it
- How writing his [book](https://www.amazon.com/Everyday-Rails-Testing-RSpec-test-driven-ebook/dp/B077S8QCG2) impacted his views
- Start small
- And much, much more!
