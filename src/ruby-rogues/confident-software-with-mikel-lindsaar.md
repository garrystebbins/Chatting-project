## Confident Software with Mikel Lindsaar

On today's episode, Charles and Dave discuss&nbsp; **Confident Software with Mikel Lindsaar.** &nbsp;Mikel wrote the Mail Gem, which is what he is known for in the Ruby community and rewrote TMail back in 2010. In the same year, he founded Reinteractive,&nbsp;a development company which is focused Ruby on Rails around the world. Tune in to learn more about what he's up to and find out what the episode has in store for you!

## The Mail Gem Story

Mikel's discovery about the Mail Gem was born out of his journey in Rails around 2006 or 2007. He built the relationship management system which handled contact database system. One of its features was that it allowed the user to write and send an email within the platform and seeing the person on the other end in the system. Things were doing well with Rails and TMail. He built another feature which lets the system capture the incoming email. Email thread is seen within the customer&nbsp;management system. One day he discovered that whenever TMail receives a mail-formed message, the system ultimately crashes it. Email problems in the office came to his desk, leading him to rewrite a mail library.

## Message to Junior Developers

One thing developers need to know, particularly those who are new, is that you don't need permission to write a fundamental part of a programming language.&nbsp;There are so many things out there that need to be done. Don't think that everything's been worked on and nothing's left for you to do.

> _You just need this sort of attitude to believe you can do it and just do it. There are no rules around this. If you build something that works, people will use it. -_ Mikel Lindsaar

Mikel is currently in search of someone who could work with him in the Mail Gem. Years after it was first written, the -number of contributors have significantly increased. There are a lot of people keeping it up-to-date and maintaining it, mostly from Germany base camp.&nbsp;If you are a young developer who wishes to have a break, just contact Mikel.
