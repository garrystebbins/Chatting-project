Bob&nbsp;is the President of [Zeidman Consulting](https://www.zeidmanconsulting.com/index.htm),&nbsp;a company dedicated in&nbsp;assisting clients and lawyers during litigation. He is an expert on patents, trade secrets, and&nbsp;copyrights of hardware and software. Tune in and be informed about the legal issues in programming!

## **Software Intellectual Property**

Software intellectual property revolves around copyrights, trade secrets, and patents. Copyrights&nbsp;protect the actual code from being copied. When someone from one company takes a code to another company, he is committing copyright infringement. This concerns two aspects: substantial and creative.&nbsp;The substantial part deals with&nbsp;a fixed component&nbsp;or code in a program. Meanwhile, the creative aspect deals with the way that code was executed.

## **Awareness is Key**

In his years of experience, Bob felt that only few programmers understand the legal issues. A number&nbsp;are confused with the aspects concerned.

> “There were 99 ways you could have done that didn't copy, so you must have a reason for copying it and that's wrong.” -Bob Zeidman

There was one case about copying a standard routine. Bob worked for the plaintiff.&nbsp;The defendant had 2,999 other ways to implement the code, but he chose that specific one because he knew it worked.

## **Consulting Lawyers**

When working for a client, it's common to doubt whether you can reuse a component or not. You can provide a license but&nbsp;keep the copyright. Lawyers exist to protect their clients.&nbsp;A good businessman is someone who&nbsp;consults his lawyer about&nbsp;the situation and the best possible way to do it.&nbsp;Enable your lawyer to see the situation from a business standpoint, and help him help you.To hear about \_Software Intellectual Property and Forensics with Bob Zeidman&nbsp;\_download and listen to the entire episode.
