### **Episode Summary**

Daniel Pritchett started doing Ruby in 2012. Lately he has been working on publishing a book on building Chatbots in Ruby using a framework called Lita and does infrastructure for a startup called [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/). Gremlin reaches out to servers and tries to find weak spots so that you can be proactive about solving these problems and be better prepared when fires do start. Daniel’s real purpose in joining the show today was to talk about his book _Build Chatbot Interactions. _Daniel talks about what he defines as a chatbot. His book teaches you how to program a chatbot with a dozen or so different chatbot skills. Daniel talks about his first community chatbot, [@elvis](https://github.com/memtech/elvis/commits/master?after=04ab6163765e89d769527b03399dbb068fae747d+470) on #memtech IRC, which picked up [immediate contributions from local developers](https://github.com/memtech/elvis/graphs/contributors?from=2014-06-01&to=2014-12-10&type=c).

Daniel istructs listeners how to host chatbots and some of the skills that people can pull together for a chatbot from his book. The panel talks about things they would like to do with chatbots, as well as some of the drawbacks and things you have to be careful with. Each skill in Daniel’s book can be a stand-alone skill, or they can be combined. Daniel talks about what convinced him to write a book instead of doing tutorials online.
