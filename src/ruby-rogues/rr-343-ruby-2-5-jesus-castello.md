- New methods like Kernel#yield\_self (Discuss possible uses) Removed “ubygems.rb” file from stdlib. (We can talk about why this file existed & why it has been removed.)
- Elixir and writing code fast
- Ruby performance (Why do so many people complain about it, is it really a limiting factor for them? Would people be happy if it got 3 times faster? [Ruby 3x3 project](https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-3-by-3))
- And much much more
