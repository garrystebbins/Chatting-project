This week on our panel, we have Avdi Grimm.** AVDI:&nbsp; **Hello.** CHUCK:&nbsp; **We have David Brady.** DAVID:&nbsp; **Hello.** CHUCK:&nbsp; **We have James Edward Gray.** DAVID:&nbsp; **Hello from the Skype interface.** CHUCK:&nbsp; **And I'm Charles Max Wood from DevChat.tv. Real quick, I just want to mention again that I'm going to be doing this Rails Ramp Up Course on Ruby on Rails. It’s kind of a mix between the course and coaching. And you can go sign up at RailsRampUp.com. I know that not everyone’s interested but if you can help me get the word out even if you're not at the place where you want to learn Rails, I’d really appreciate that. So, I just want to thank our newest Unofficial Rogue, it’s Avi Flombaum. I hope I said that right, from the Flatiron School. Thanks for supporting the show and we really, really appreciate it.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yes. Thank you.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Woohoo!** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Alright. Let’s get into the show. This week, we’re kind of doing something a little bit lighter. We had some long shows and some deep shows.** DAVID:**&nbsp;Now, we’re going to have a short, shallow show. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp;We promise, no useful content for the next hour.** CHUCK:&nbsp;**Don’t dive in head first, you'll probably hit the bottom and break your neck. But…okay… [Laughter]**DAVID:&nbsp;**Sorry, bro! [Crosstalk]**CHUCK:&nbsp;**Never mind. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp;So, what are we talking about?** CHUCK: **&nbsp;What are we talking about?** DAVID:&nbsp; **Somebody pick something.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Somebody pick something? Alright, I’ll pick something. Have you guys seen these articles recently about Ernie Miller had the first -- one I saw about why he likes to work in Louisville, working remotely for people? And then, there was another one just the other day from Stack Overflow about why they like to hire remote workers. So basically, it was cool just the position there because you got the remote worker telling you why you should be a remote worker and then you got the company telling you why you should have remote workers. Did you guys see those?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I didn’t but I'm keenly interested.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yes! Pretty cool stuff. It was about there are so many advantages to working remote as far as like happiness and comfort and being able to live in a place like Louisville in Ernie’s case, or Oklahoma in my case where the cost of living is so significantly different from your typical tech-booming centers, things like that, and how that overall happiness translates in your work flow. And then Stack Overflow basically confirmed it by like saying, “Yeah. Basically, we see when we find remote workers that they actually tend to work more than people who come in to office.” Because you know, the guy comes in to the office; he’s sitting on the chair all the time. But he’ll surf a little bit or whatever, hang out at the water cooler, whatever. Whereas the guy at home, he’s usually pouring over it and putting in a lot of hours and stuff like that. They did admit that it’s not for everybody. But overall, they felt like when you found the right person, that it was a great tip.** AVDI: **&nbsp; You what would be cool? If there was like a podcast that interviewed people who work remotely and find out how they make it work.** JAMES: **&nbsp; That would be really cool. What would that podcast be called?** AVDI: **&nbsp; I don’t know. Like why teams or something, that’s probably a stupid name.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah, that would be dumb.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Jesus! Who would want to do something like that?** DAVID: **&nbsp; Boring!** JAMES: **&nbsp; What did you find out when doing all those interviews? I personally know some of them but like, what have you found overall?** AVDI: **&nbsp; I've talked to a lot of people who are very, very happy; a lot happier than they were working in an office. Different people have different reasons for wanting to work remotely. But a lot of them have to do with just being able to live where you want to live, not being sort of jerked around the country by the job situation. And a lot of people are incredibly happy that they don’t have to commute anymore.** JAMES:**&nbsp; Except they cuts in your podcast listening. [Laughter]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; I heard that so many times.** AVDI: **&nbsp; That’s kind of the irony that we’ve noted on many episodes is it’s a podcast about working remotely. But a lot of times, I talked to people who now work remotely in a large part because of the good reports that they heard on the podcast and then went and found themselves remote jobs. Now, they don’t listen to the podcast anymore because they don’t have to commute.** JAMES:**&nbsp; That’s a waste. [Laughter]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. I met a lot of people at conferences and they're like, “Yeah, I used to listen to two or three of your shows and then I started working from home or I started looking ten minutes away and I'm way behind now.”** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Sam&nbsp;Livingston-Gray, he said they listen while they're washing dishes. I thought that was cool.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Some people listen while they're running and stuff like that. But yeah, I mean, a lot of people just report -- a lot of people talk about having more time with their families and just being more flexible, being able to stop in the middle of the day and go for a run and stuff like that. But I think the thing I hear the most is that it’s not that big a deal. They might have gone into it thinking that it would be really hard. But it turns out that they're very happy in their teams, everybody in the team is happy, and they work together just fine.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; That’s cool.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Alright, Avdi. You pick something.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I pick something. You see, I got to kind of preserve my picks today because not having planned for this ‘Picksplosion’, I only have like two. But this is one of those things that you guys have probably picked before because it seems to be more and more the case. But I finally watched one of Noel Rappin’s talks from 2012. The version I watched was ‘Let’s Make Testing Fun Again’ from Chicago Ruby. And it was really good. I always enjoy his talks. And of course, we had him on the show, right?** CHUCK: **&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; He's one of the only people that’s been on both this show and JavaScript Jabber, actually.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Okay, right. It’s a show about testing, obviously or talked about testing. A lot of it was kind of stuff that I kind of knew about writing good tests. But there were some things in there that I think will improve my testing game. And there was some thought provoking things like I've gotten into the habit of naming my inner RSpec description blocks just after the method that they test. And he advocates a more semantic naming style for those. So, like when I was just doing where I would have described it, made the inner description .add endorsement for gem, just the name of the method. He might make a more semantic name that doesn’t tie it directly to the name of the method like describe adding an endorsement to a gem or something.** JAMES:**&nbsp; Okay. So, I actually want to talk about that point because I am doing good at using a good descriptive name for like the ‘if’, the ‘it’ block in RSpec and the describe contents. It’s usually just the class or the module or whatever. Where I seem to fall down and die is when I do nested context. And what really kills me is with something like active record because for some reason, I just want to group those as like associations, validations, stuff like that. But then, it doesn’t read right. Like it’s my model associations belongs to a [inaudible]. It doesn’t read right. So, how did you handle that in your context form? That’s weird.**AVDI: **&nbsp; For me, like with active record, my alt is usually just I don’t test stuff like associate -- like I don’t test the fact that an association is there. So, that kind of simplifies it for me.** JAMES:**&nbsp; I sometimes don’t. Like if it’s stupid simple but sometimes, if I do a ‘[inaudible] through’ or if I have to set some complicated qualifier on it.**AVDI: **&nbsp; Right.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah. Anytime that you're going to customize the association in some way, I think it’s good to test it. I don’t know. Like, the description like -- I could see having a block that’s just like testing descriptions or something. Not descriptions, testing associations. I can't talk today.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; [Laughs]**AVDI: **&nbsp; It’s just like describe associations or something like that. I don’t know. I'm not sure. But it was kind of weird looking at that because like back when I got started using years and years ago with RSpec, I did have more semantic names for like the functionality of those testing. Like the describe blocks, the functionality I was testing rather than just the method name that I was testing. And then, I kind of switched because a lot of the people were using just class name and the method name. And now, I'm wondering about that.** JAMES: **&nbsp; You know, we should just say that since we’re taking about Noel’s video that Noel is like a great guy. If you run into him at a conference, have dinner with him. Like a super nice guy, fun to talk to. So, he was awesome.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I totally second that.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I usually wind up spending a bit of time with him at the conferences that I’m attending with him.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah, he’s really a good guy.** AVDI:**&nbsp; Are there like multiple Noels? How does he have time to be a great guy to have dinner with for like everybody? [Laughter]**CHUCK:**&nbsp; Well, he used to work for Groupon. So, they just send him everywhere. [Laughter]**DAVID:**&nbsp; I thought you're going to say he’s worked for Groupon. So, everybody had this half off coupons for a dinner with Noel. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; One of our pages says Noel Rappin. There he goes.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. Why don’t we make Dave pick something?** DAVID: **&nbsp; Okay. I've got a controversial pick. I'm not sure I'm going to do this one. But I've got a very expensive pick and a really fun pick. And I'm going to do the ‘I Can't Believe It Hasn’t Been Picked Yet’ pick. I need to do that one first. And that is the Pickaxe book. Whoever heard of this? Actually, working through our current client, we’ve got some people that are coming to Ruby from .NET. And we’re kind of -- Chuck and I are working together on that. And it’s kind of a brainless, you're tired, you're poor kind of environment and it’s a lot of fun. And two days ago I think, I found out that two of the guys on the team had never heard of the Pickaxe book. It was a total face palm forehead slap moment. These guys had been brought in later. I've gone off there for the original meet up with these guys and told them, “You want the Pickaxe book, you need the Agile Development on Rails if you're going to go that route and you need this and this and this.” And I gave them a bunch of resources. And the first resource was the Pickaxe book. Now, these two guys came on later and didn’t get that speech. So, they’ve never heard of this book. And for those of you that are interested, Pickaxe book is now in 5<sup>th</sup> Edition. It was last updated in August of 2012. So, it’s fairly up to date. It covers 1.9.3.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I'm going to interrupt you real quick, Dave.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah, please.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; For those who are new to Ruby, the Pickaxe book is Programming Ruby by Dave Thomas and I think there's a co-author/sub-authors.** JAMES: **&nbsp; So, I'm going to interrupt you now, Chuck. The book is now actually called Programming Ruby 1.9. And they did that to -- I think it was during the 1.8/ 1.9 transition. They didn’t want it to just replace the original Programming Ruby or something like that. Anyway, I think it is now actually called Programming Ruby 1.9.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; So, we’re going to pop the stack again and I'm just going to mention that you should go to PragProg.com and buy it. That way, you can get the digital version or the paper version if you would like. I’ll put a link to that and I’ll also put a link to Amazon. And that way, if you just want the paper version, then you can give us a little affiliate click. But I recommend going to PragProg.com and buying it there because they give you freebies. They give you good stuff.** DAVID: **&nbsp; If you go to PragProg.com and give them the public address or the private Email address of your Kindle, they’ll Email the book to your Kindle. And so, it will just show up.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. The other nice thing is if you get the electronic version and there are changes to the book, then they’ll let you know.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Then, you can upgrade your book for free, the electronic version. So, one point of clarity. It is called Programming Ruby 1.9. The official title is 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition. I just said it was in 5<sup>th</sup> Edition. That’s not technically correct. The book is now in Version5.0. If you open the book to the ISP cover page, it says Version 5.0 August 2012. But the cover says 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition. So, that can be a little bit misleading. So, you are looking for 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition but what's inside would be Version 5.0. And for those of you that are new to Ruby, this is the Ruby book. This is the book that covers, the first half explains how to program in Ruby, how Ruby works, how to start Ruby, how to shut Ruby down, how to fork Ruby, how threading works, how all the bits of Ruby work. And then the second half of the book is a reference to the core -- Ruby core and standard library are the things that ship with Ruby. Plus a bunch of the extra libraries, right?** JAMES:**&nbsp; It covers the standard [inaudible], most of the things in the standard web but they get pretty short; introductory, descriptions. I know this is going to sound weird but read the freaking reference.**DAVID: **&nbsp; Yes!** JAMES: **&nbsp; I think that is one of my secret weapons as a Ruby programmer is that I've actually read the reference in the back of the book. Like, all the time I’ll just throw out some weird method that’s saying a part of core Ruby and people are like, “Where is that? How did you know that was there?” I was like, “It’s in the reference at the back of the Pickaxe.”** DAVID: **&nbsp; I was debugging through some code the other day and I came across a commit from Chuck Wood and it had ‘date.’ and the ‘strftime’ on it was done wrong. He literally typed the function wrong. He typed ‘strptime’ and then just gunked up the rest of the line. And I just lost it, like, “I can't believe Chuck didn’t even test this stupid method.” And I was about to pull Chuck into our Skype call and just yell at him that, “How did you commit this code without…?” And then I thought, “You know, I'm just going to Google this.” And yeah, it’s new in 1.9.3. There's a new method in 1.9.3 called ‘strptime’ and it’s the opposite of ‘strftime’. It’s a ‘string parse time’ instead of ‘string format time’. I never would have known that.** JAMES: **&nbsp; I'm actually not sure if that’s new in 1.9. I know it was in 1.8 but I can't remember if you had to require time to get it in 1.8.** DAVID: **&nbsp; That may have been. When I pulled up the reference for 1.9.1, I think, it was not there. So, it’s doing the hokey-pokey. It’s in, then it’s out, then it’s in. So yeah, get the latest book. It’s valuable. That’s my pick.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Nice!** JAMES: **&nbsp; I have another one of those I read through the picks recently. I can't believe it wasn’t in there. And that’s Ruby Toolbox. Do you guys use that at all?** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Sometimes. [Crosstalk]**DAVID:**&nbsp; Okay, I’ll be the idiot. I've never heard of this. What is it? [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; Ruby Toolbox is the site where you go pick a category for something you want like if you're getting ready to do some Geocoding and putting Google Maps kind of stuff. You’d pick the Maps in Geocoding category. And then it will tell you what extensions people are using. They're like ranked in what's most popular. So, what's good about it is like if you haven't done Rails in a while or you have but you haven't had to do this specific kind of thing in a while. You go to Ruby Toolbox and you're like, “Hey, I'm going to do pagination now and that’s world paginate.” It’s like, “No dude. Everybody’s bored done from world paginate. This is what they're using now,” whatever. And you can find out what people are using which is usually best supported, best being under active development and stuff like that. It’s a really handy tool.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Nice. I'm going to go ahead and jump in and pick something. I'm going to pick something that’s not Ruby development related but it’s something that has made my life a little bit better. It’s actually OldApps.com. Have you guys heard of this?** DAVID: **&nbsp; No.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; So, what it is, is it has like all of the free or open source software out there as they update the versions usually on their websites, you can't get the old versions. So, for example Skype. Skype 6.0 is awful, ugly, terrible. Of course, Skype 5 got anything is the same, it’s just less terrible. But the thing is I just got tired of all of the antics that Skype 6.0 and 6.1 are putting me through. So, if you go to OldApps.com, and you click Macintosh in the top right, or Linux or whatever, they have Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. I actually went and downloaded Skype 5.8 and I upgraded my 6.1 version to 5.8. And it’s been nice. It works, it works fine. It doesn’t have all the funky garbage that they keep adding in. They put restrictions into Skype 6 because they want you to pay for some of the features that were free before, and some of the other features that are still free but just don’t work right unless you do some funny stuff with them. And the interface is cleaner. So, OldApps.com is definitely a good one if you want to roll back to an older version of something free like Firefox, or Skype, or anything like that.** DAVID: **&nbsp; It’s cool.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I want to jump back real quick about the Pickaxe and just say I've done a lot of researching things for some of my book writing, like cross-referencing between the Pickaxe and the Ruby Programming Language by Matz and Flanagan. And if you're going to get just one of them, I would still recommend the Pickaxe. There's been a bunch of topics that I went to look up and I found more information about them in the Pickaxe than in the O’Reilly book.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah. It’s one of the oldest references for Ruby out there in English but it’s updated and it is the most relevant.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; The other one I like as a reference is The Ruby Way by Hal Fulton.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Oh, yes! That’s essential, yeah.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s kind of different from the Pickaxe in the sense that you -- it’s more comprehensive, I guess because he covers like every last little thing that is in Ruby.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Well, I think of it as closer to a recipe book. I mean, it’s not a formal recipes book. But it kind of takes that form. It’s a lot of how to get particular tasks done using the Ruby standard library.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Agree.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Yeah. They're great books. I don’t know if The Ruby Way has been updated to Ruby 1.9.0. [Crosstalk]**JAMES: **&nbsp; I can't remember.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I can't say it has.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah. I can't remember. It’s been too long since I've read it.** DAVID:**&nbsp; My copy of the paper book hasn’t changed in a couple of years. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; What?! You didn’t get the upload thing where you just plug it in?** DAVID: **&nbsp; No.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I have the 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition which I thought was the 1.9 Edition. But now, I'm wondering.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. It’s a pretty thick book.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Who’s next?** JAMES: **&nbsp; I got one. So, I finally started using Chrome as my browser all the time which I think I'm the last person on earth to do. But the cool thing about using Chrome as a browser is you get to play around with all the cool stuff in the Chrome ecosystem. Have you guys found Vimium? It’s a browser extension that you plug in.** DAVID: **&nbsp; There's one in Firefox as well. It is Vimium navigation keys?** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah, basically. Vimium is like the navigation in Chrome for moving around but the thing I love about it is that the ability to like click links into my keyboard. You can like hit F for flying then it basically pops up a little one or two letter combo on top of all the links on the page. And then you just like type whatever two layer combo you want and it clicks that link for you. You can just navigate around. It’s awesome. I love that. It’s really good.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; That’s really cool.** DAVID: **&nbsp; I've seen that for Firefox and I love -- you hit the hotkey. And just having it annotate all of the things that are clickable on the page. It’s actually a really useful like debugging tool.** JAMES: **&nbsp; That’s true as well. They’re just seeing what I could interact with, right?** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I'm only used to using key bindings for all kinds of things like that and so being able to move that over even if the key bindings aren’t exactly the same, is really, really handy.** JAMES: **&nbsp; You can customize whatever it binds to as well, if you want to change them. But it’s really nice. I'm enjoying it.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Is it blasphemy if it’s called Vimium to rebind everything to Emacs key bindings? [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; I don’t know. It’s a good question.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; David, do you want to throw another one out there?** DAVID:**&nbsp; Oh, sure. Let’s see. Yeah. So, I’ll do a real quick one. I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t work this topic into the show somewhere. [Crosstalk]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; Oh, no!** DAVID:**&nbsp; Someone sent me a gift book the other day. This book is called the Kama Pootra. It’s like 50 Mind Blowing Ways to Poop. If you're not into that kind of humor, this book is not for you. [Laughter]**DAVID:**&nbsp; If you are into this kind of humor, it is side-splittingly funny. It’s potty humor all the way. It’s just drawing after drawing after drawing of different ways to approach and deliver, if you will. And they do a pretty good mockery of the Kama Sutra with the contortionist positions and just silliness. And there's positions on your own, positions with a partner, that kind of stuff. And if that kind of humor is up your alley, it’s crying out loud funny. And that’s all I’ll say about that. [Laughter]**DAVID:**&nbsp; [Laughs] In case that’s not your type of humor.**JAMES:**&nbsp; It is noticed that people send David a lot of gifts. Am I just getting it wrong? [Laughter]**DAVID:**&nbsp; They're all gifts about poop. Do you still want to play this game? [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; Oh, I did not notice but Kama Pootra has its own website. So, I’ll link that.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Nice!** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Nice! Oh, that’s so funny. So, one thing that I've been trying lately, I haven't picked this before on the show, is it’s an app called Contactually. I know that several of us run our own businesses and so we need to keep leads warm and things like that. What this does is it actually hooks into my Gmail or Google Apps Mail and it sends me reminders to keep up with people. [Laughs] It’s so funny to me because I'm so bad at this. And so, it’s so convenient for it to do it. And it looks like I got an Email from them yesterday, you know, because you get the automated Emails when you sign up for these services. It looks like it’ll actually hook into your CRM. So, I'm going to plug it in and see how it works with my CRM and see how that all works. But so far, it’s just been terrific and it allows you to sort your contacts into buckets. And that way, it knows how to handle them, how often you need to keep track of them and things like that. So, I've really liked it so far. I've been using it for about two or three weeks. And it has made it much, much easier for me to keep on top of following up on leads and keeping in contact with potential vendors and sponsors and things like that. And so anyway, I'm going to recommend that.**AVDI: **&nbsp; That looks really cool. One of the things that I was kind of hurting for when I was a bit more of like a fulltime consultant was a good one person CRM. I found a bunch of tools that seem like they were really customized for large app sharing contacts around and I really wanted something that was just like help me keep track of my leads and remind me to take the next step with them.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. That’s exactly what this does for me. It’s, “Hey, you haven't Emailed this person in a while.” Lets you see what's going on.** AVDI: **&nbsp; So, on the topic of following up, I cannot believe I haven't picked this before. I actually really think I have, but I don’t see it in the pick list. So something that I use constantly is a service called FollowUp.cc. I've been using this for a couple of years now, I think. And it’s a really simple service where you basically, if you're going through your Email and you have something that you need to take action on sometime later, you just forward it to like 1h@followup.cc or 3d@followup.cc or January@followup.cc. Basically, it’s just a real simple syntax for addresses that express exactly when you want to be reminded of it. And they keep a calendar of reminders for you and they’ll send you a reminder when the time comes which you can act on or there’s actually links in it to snooze it for different lengths of time. And there are also some other nice use of it like they publish a calendar feed that you can plug into your calendar if you want to actually see when your reminders are coming up and stuff. Actually, the picks that I had today, I sent to myself with&nbsp;FollowUp.cc to come to me on Wednesday because I wanted to be reminded of them today. Like I said, I've been using it for a long time. Really, it’s a relatively inexpensive service and it’s totally worth it.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Cool!** CHUCK: **&nbsp; That looks really cool. So, I want to change tacks a little bit. I'm kind of curious. It’s funny, on our back channel, we’ll talk about some of these picks and we’ll actually say like, “Oh, you recommended this and I tried it out and I really liked it.” So, are there any picks that somebody else picked on the show that you guys got hooked on?** JAMES:**&nbsp; Oh, yeah! This is kind of ironic though because I needed a markdown preview app and I went searching and I found one and it was great. And I thought, “I'm going to pick this.” Then I've stomped myself on like, “I should go see if that’s in our picks.” And Josh had picked it like the week before. So, I didn’t get hooked on it because Josh picked it. I found it separately but I totally agree. And that’s MarkedApp.com. It was really good. And that was something that’s been picked before. And then Katrina picked that Wordoid.com site which I'm basically addicted to now. I like to go to that site and scroll through and look for different word combinations and stuff. I can't wait till I have to name something. And yeah, I haven't had that [inaudible] project recently but I'm totally using Wordoid.com for that. So, in the spirit of that and throwing out a new pick, I also found Wordnik &nbsp;recently and that site has to be like the best, the sortest online because you can go in there, look for a word and you have to scroll way down, pass the definitions and stuff. But there's like hypernyms, synonyms, words for use in the same contents, just crazy amount of great stuff. So when you're struggling for a name, try Wordnik. It’s awesome.**AVDI:**&nbsp; You know what happens for me is I don’t have a specific example that comes to mind but I know there have been a few cases where I've been watching my Twitter feed and somebody is like, “I found this great tool because of a Ruby Rogues pick.” And I’ll look at it and I’ll be like, “Hey, that looks cool.” [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah, I've totally done that.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I was apparently spacing out when it was picked the first time but when somebody will mention it again, I was like, “Oh, yeah! I should use that.”** JAMES:**&nbsp; I have to tell a funny story about picks. Katrina pursued that cooking video one time with the how to figure out if the pan is at the perfect temperature. And I watched that video, that short little video and I felt like it had awakened something in my mind, like I was now smarter. And so, I went in, I told my wife, “Did you know there’s this amazing trick you can do to tell you if your pan is at the right temperature?” And she’s like, “Oh, yeah. You put a little drop of water in and if it bounces around like a baby, right?” I'm like, “We’ve been married 15 years and you were hiding this from me?” [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; “What do you say you're holding out on?!”** JAMES: **&nbsp; I know. It’s like, “Geez!”** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Oh, yeah. One of the ones that James picked that I got hooked on, he and several other people I know kept recommending it. So, I finally broke down and started watching Downton Abbey with my wife. And I'm hooked. I'm hooked for life, I think.** JAMES: **&nbsp;Yeah, it’s great show.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; It’s such a terrific show. The thing is like the personal interplay between the characters is interesting and there's just so much there that is fascinating to me. For example, just the difference between the aristocracy and everybody else and then the people who work for them. And the other thing that’s really interesting to me is like all the different technology that is up and coming at that time and the way that the world is changing. And some of the things that have affected things that have happened within our lifetimes are really, really interesting. Anyway, it’s been really, really fun to watch the show and kind of see what's there. And I've actually gone and like looked up some of the historical context of some of the stuff that’s going on to try and understand what they're talking about, and why the characters care about some of these things. And it’s just been really, really cool.** JAMES:**&nbsp; I've also gotten hooked on things to watch. Josh picked Sherlock at one point, the BBC series of Sherlock. And I finally got around to watch in the first season of that this week, which is amazing. It’s a really great show, goes really fast. And then also, I've picked Big Bang Theory in the past. And Josh has been totally trying to reform by show watching. He shows in his articles about why he’s watching Big Bang Theory. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; Which is really good. And the latest one he sent me said, “If you're hooked on it and you want to try something else, try Community.” And so, I started watching Community recently until the first season of that. And that is also crazy funny.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah, it’s fun.** JAMES: **&nbsp; It’s very good. The references in that like they throw out so many pop cultural references and they're often like one word. And they're timed so perfectly. And you're just like, “I know I'm only getting like half of them.” It’s very cool. Check out Community.** DAVID:**&nbsp; I have a pick that really, really works for me. And this is kind of a two for -- it’s a pick that James picked but it’s also shilling for Avdi because it’s Ruby Tapas which as you know, one of the people on Ruby Rogues puts out, this is not a paid endorsement, just so you guys know. But I was talking with the guys the other day… [Crosstalk]**JAMES:**&nbsp; Why is Avdi handing you that \$100 bill? [Laughter]**AVDI:**&nbsp; Shut up! Shut up! [Laughter]**DAVID:**&nbsp; So, I was working with a co-worker a couple of days ago and he was asking for -- he’s got the Pickaxe book and he’s running various stuff and he’s watching PeepCodes and he’s watched RailsCasts and he’s like, “So, what's the next thing to do?” I said, “Well, what you need to do is just broaden your knowledge base and just deepen it.” And I realized that probably one of the best learning resources right now is Ruby Tapas because one day, Avdi will cover something really, really simple. And the next day, he will cover something that’s right there in the spec. It’s really obvious. But it’s mind-blowingly deep. And they're just really well-produced. I’d say they're really well-written but it’s not like Avdi has [inaudible] write on some show or anything. [Crosstalk]**JAMES: **&nbsp; …damn it!** DAVID:**&nbsp; Yeah, exactly. [Laughter]**AVDI: **&nbsp; Thank you, David.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah. I highly recommend RubyTapas. It’s one of the best resources out there right now.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Heck, yeah! They're so good.** DAVID: **&nbsp; They're wafer thin. That’s the best part.** JAMES: **&nbsp; That is actually the best part like when a Ruby Tapas video pops up and it’s like under five minutes, it’s like, “Why not launch this right now?”** AVDI:**&nbsp; Yeah, it’s funny. In making those, when I started out, I still kind of felt a little compelled to try to get as much content into an episode as possible. And the more I make them, the more I feel like my ideal episode is going to be 30 seconds long. [Laughter]**AVDI: **&nbsp; Not because I want to stretch it out just because I feel like I really am trying to zero in on that just one new thing that you can actually remember because it wasn’t overloading you. And yeah, I want to get my 30-second episode. One of these days, I’ll get it. Speaking of Big Bang Theory, I don’t watch it but I think my mom forwarded this to me. One thing I saw interesting lately was that one of the stars of that show is actually creating a television series that will be profiling young geniuses basically - young engineering and programming and creative geniuses from around the world . I will just paste in the first article I found about this into the notes.** JAMES: **&nbsp; That sounds awesome.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Cool!** JAMES:**&nbsp; RubyTapas, very worth it. Like every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you can start your morning with a short little video and then you have Avdi tell you, “Happy Hacking!” [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; Yes.** AVDI:**&nbsp; I actually had somebody -- I screwed up a show recently and it was missing a little bit of audio from the beginning until the end. And I got somebody tweet at me on Twitter, “No ‘happy hacking’ today?” [Laughter]**AVDI: **&nbsp; I was like, “Oh, crap!” I had to go and fix it.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I have one other pick.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Go for it.** AVDI: **&nbsp; There's this article iteration inside and out on a blog which is rapidly becoming one of my favorite programming blogs because there's some really good content on it. And it basically covers, in more depth than I've seen anywhere else, the difference between internal iteration and external iteration. And which is something that we sort of use, those are both concepts that I think we use implicitly in Ruby but you may not have thought about the distinction before and what it means for different types of iteration and why sometimes internal iteration is very elegant and sometimes, it’s brutal. And sometimes, the reverse is that sometimes it’s external iteration that’s very elegant for one case and terribly ugly for others.** JAMES: **&nbsp; It’s kind of a cool concept in Ruby now that Ruby can basically turn internal into external.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yes. I don’t know. I can't remember if any of them have gone up yet. But I’d created a whole series of Ruby Tapas episodes about enumerator in Ruby. And this was sort of very timely for that. I think it actually came out after I’d created most of them but it’s very timely. It’s great continued reading from that series because I talk about external iterators but I don’t actually define them and this really goes into detail explaining the difference.** JAMES:**&nbsp; That’s cool. And there are a couple of small ones that I’d like to throw out real quick. First, Github released this library for how they do the processing in like common fields and stuff like that where it’s basically this pipeline of transformations, you know, the good things like the markdown conclusion, the syntax highlighting, all that kind of stuff. And you can use what they use now to do all these various transformations and insert things you want into the pipeline somewhere or kick things out you don’t want. I thought that was kind of cool just a simple hack. I know there are thing in pipeline. They have this great [inaudible] that you can just do on the command line using pipeline and you're serving this current directory on the, get it through a web server. And I've always been jealous of that. Like we can do it with WEBrick but it’s just not like a pretty one-liner. You know what I mean? Like a to make it easy, you throw a directory on the web. But Jeremy Hinegardner has the Heel gem. And that will do the same thing for us. So, you can just fire it up in some directories being served through the web server. So, I find that ridiculously convenient when I have some project and I just want to browse it with the web browser. And it can do -- Heel will add syntax highlighting if you want and stuff like that. And so, that was cool. And then just one other tiny cooling that I've seen recently, Steve Klabnik re-implemented the programming language whose name I cannot say on the air. [Laughter]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah, family friendly. Oh wait, never mind.** JAMES:**&nbsp; Right. Yeah, we’d lose our family friendly rating. But he did it instead of using the usable ASCII symbols that he uses, he used Emoji for the various [inaudible]. This actually is a cooler project than you think because it’s called Mojikun, by the way. And it’s cool because instead of just doing it as like a simple hack, he actually tried to structure it more like a language with a Lexer, or a Parser, a Runtime, and an Interpreter. But it’s all pretty small and simple. So, if you're not super familiar with those concepts or whatever, this is a great thing to look through and get the idea of how different pieces of a language work and stuff. Those are just some tiny things I've seen lately that I thought were all cool.**DAVID: **&nbsp; That is very cool.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah.** DAVID:**&nbsp; I've got my really controversial pick and I've got a really expensive pick. So, I’ll throw the expensive one and if we run out of time, I don’t have to deal with the controversy. So, I've been experimenting with standing desks for a while and with various amounts of success. I took a regular desk and built a little standing shelf where I could place my keyboard and my monitor. And that worked for a while. But moving back and forth, been sitting and sitting was difficult. I couldn’t stand all day because it made my back hurt. And so, jumping in wholeheartedly was difficult. I ended up buying, trying to go cold turkey and just doing standing only. And that desk is now out in the hallway because I just couldn’t hack it. And so, I finally broke down and went to VersaTables.com. There's a bunch of different companies that make electric desks but if you want to Google for this, you're looking for an Electric Sit-Stand Desk and you can search various vendors out there right now. I found this on VersaTables.com and they'll just start at about $830 and they go up -- the model I got was by the time I put all the accessories on, it was about $1400. So, it was not a cheap desk. But this, for me, is the happiest sound in the world. I don’t know if this will come through. [Rumbling sound]**DAVID:**&nbsp; That was my desk going up. [Rumbling sound]**DAVID: **&nbsp; And that’s my desk coming back down. And I love this because it will lift 200 or 300 pounds. So, you're not going to have a problem with it if you load all your computers on it. There is an accessory. If you get a Versa Tables desk, if you're using it for your computer, there's an accessory that I bought and have not installed and I've already learned painfully that this is not an option. They make a CPU holder. And what this is just a little bar that hangs down off the bottom of the desk and has a bracket for bolting your big box computer to the bottom of the desk. And then when you raise the desk, the computer goes up which means that the computer is following the monitors which means your cables are not being stretched out. I did actually rip a video cable out of the back of my Mac Pro yesterday. And the cable came off but all pins on the cable plug stayed in the video adaptor. And so, when I reached down to try and touch things, I got a little shock and the Mac Pro rebooted itself. So, that’s that. Just so we’re clear. You don’t want that happening to your computer equipment. So, the CPU attachment, not an option. If you got a computer, you want that. And I wish I had a coupon code from these guys. I’ll see if I can. I’ll Email these guys and tell them I picked them on the show and would they give a coupon for our listeners. And if they give us one, I’ll put it up on the website.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Which model do you have?** DAVID: **&nbsp; It’s the electric desk. The…what did they call it?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Edison Electric?** DAVID:**&nbsp; The Edison Electric, I think is the thing. Yeah, it’s just the electric lift table is all it’s called. And you go in and you basically -- what you're paying for is the little Robotic Solenoid sort of, in the legs to raise and lower the pistons. And you go in and you say how long do you want the desk, how deep do you want the desk. And I'm a desk real estate [inaudible] and so I bought the largest plain cover that they would sell me on top of the desk. That’s part of why it ended up being so expensive.**AVDI: **&nbsp; Is it an actual plank of wood?** DAVID: **&nbsp; No. It’s MDF but it’s got a lovely veneer on top of it.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Because that’s one of the things that’s kind of steered me away from some of these, a couple of these electric adjustable desks is it’s like -- I don’t know. I can't see paying $800 to over $1000 for a desk and getting like a particle board surface.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Getting a piece of cardboard on top of it. Yeah.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah. I actually thought about having somebody like getting just like a desk base and then having somebody make me a decent surface board.** DAVID:**&nbsp; Yeah. So, this one actually has a steel under-frame to it and the frame has the holes where the screws go. And so, you could totally go to a shop or [inaudible] shop and say, “Hey, I want just a countertop.” And then, just drill them out the screws where the holes are. You could totally do that. They do guarantee their desktop for life. And so, I thought, “Well, I’ll just try the thing.” I got the Cherry finish which is it’s a different color of the wallpaper, if you really want to put it that way. But it looks fantastic. I mean, it looks like a fake desktop. But I mean, it looks nice and it’s really high quality. And it’s not until you look underneath that you realize, “Oh, this is MDF.” I've been really pleased with it so far. I haven't felt motivated to replace the desktop.**JAMES: **&nbsp; This is going to sound weird but does it go pretty low?** DAVID:**&nbsp; That’s the reason I picked Versa Tables. This thing goes down to like 24 inches. It goes down so stinking low, and it will go up to 50 inches which is high enough that I would have to rest my elbows on it too, like shoulder-armpit height. And they make -- there's somebody else that make [inaudible] where they got a little computer programmable thing and you program it to, when it’s down, I want it 36.2 inches and when it’s up, I want it at 47.3. And this one doesn’t do that. And I have determined that for me, in particular, Josh says that he likes to move around. And for me particularly, this variable adjustment is perfect because I take it down to where I want it. Instead of pushing -- I could imagine it would be cool to push a button and have it go to the upper height. But I find myself noodling with the height. Like I’ll put it at one height and I’ll type for half an hour and then I’ll go, “You know what? I want an extra quarter inch of desk height.” And I’ll just bump it. And it’s great having that amount of adjustment. Eventually, I’ll have it settle on some heights and I’ll want it to just go there. I don’t know. I’ll tape a ruler at the back of the desk or something. So, it’s easy to do it.**JAMES: **&nbsp; Having a desk at the right height with a wheelchair is like super annoying because you have that controller that sticks out. So, there's like a perfect height where it’s not running into the controller but it’s also not taking me off at the knees. But that perfect height is not like a standard thing. You always have to get a desk that’s like too short and then bump it up a little bit. Put something under the legs to get it to the perfect height or whatever. Actually, I finally just broke down and paid somebody to make a custom desk that’s exactly where I want it which works great for now. But the problem is like every time you get a new wheelchair, which isn't often like every decade or so you get a new wheelchair and then the perfect sweet track changes. It does, with wheelchairs, suck.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah. This desk has an under-frame to it that’s about an inch an a quarter deep. So, there's like a little lip that’s like three inches in and then the desk goes down an inch and a half where the little bar goes underneath it. And where I end up tipping my knees up because I’ve got my foot on a footstool, my hips go past the under-frame and my knee goes up to the bottom of the desk and that works. But yeah, if you're trying to slide your knees level under the desk, you hit the under-frame. So, that would be -- you have to consider that the desk is -- you could basically pretend that the desk is two inches thick.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Right. That’s another thing is desk with lips on the front and stuff like that.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I just spent $1000 on my chair and so, I'm not sure I could spend another $1000 on a desk.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yup.** AVDI: **&nbsp; You got the Aeron?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I did. I got the Aeron. There's a pick for you. I love this thing. It is so nice. Of course, I bought it because my other chair broke and it landed me on my back on the floor. But yeah, it’s super comfortable. I really like it. It’s got this mesh material on it. And the nice thing about that is that I used to sweat on the other chair. And so, I’d get out of the chair and I’d be soaked on my back. And this is nice because it just breathes and it’s pretty comfortable. But the real thing is that not everything on this chair adjusts. And so, I can set it up so that it’s the most comfortable for me. And the other thing is that I noticed when I was getting out of the other chair that I was always, I’d get up and I just don’t want to move. And I don’t have that problem as much getting out of the Aeron’s.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Where did you buy it from?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I bought it on Amazon.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Okay.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; And they guarantee it for like 12 years. Because I've gone through three or four office chairs in the last two or three years and I hate having to replace them and then you wind up getting the cheap office chair from Office Max or something.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I've been debating whether to spend my money on a new chair or a new desk first. I can't decide.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; It depends on how you think it will affect your lifestyle while you're working.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah. Well, I've enjoyed my experiments with the standing desk but I discovered that I definitely wanted an adjustable one because my computer set up is pretty elaborate, for one thing. So, it’s really not convenient for me to like shift everything over to a make-shift standing desk.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah.** AVDI: **&nbsp; And then shift back. And it’s just -- yeah.** DAVID: **&nbsp; I got two laptops on the table and the computer underneath the table.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Right.** DAVID: **&nbsp; And I got two monitors and I really want to put a third monitor on the table. But I got this six foot long. It’s the longest table they had and I've got monitors literally hanging off of one end and a laptop literally hanging off the other end.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Right. And I've got a monitor, I've got two laptops because I've got my video editing and rendering machine and then I've got my development machine. And I've got a tablet that goes up on a holder and speakers and like a huge USB hub.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I have to ask you Dave, how deep is the desk?** DAVID: **&nbsp; They come in two widths. One is 24 inches and the other is 30. And normally, I'm a fan of super deep desks. I like 36 inches and I was a little upset that I can only go 30 inches deep at Versa Tables. But now that it’s here, it’s actually the perfect width, perfect depth because like the monitors, I got a monitor’s swing arms for it. And the monitors are now two feet away from me because they are mounted to the back of the desk. And so, 30 inches is the deepest that you can get.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Well, maybe next year. [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; Yup.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I want to try a standing desk. I've seen some like life hacker things where you can spend like \$20 or something and get a standing desk. So, I might trade that just to get a feel for it and then kind of go from there. I’ll put a link to the other ones that I found for cheap, as far as getting started with that stuff.** JAMES: **&nbsp; I've been using that cool piece of hardware, that’s not a desk, in these meetings recently for a local group and we have to record them. And there are these wide meetings in a big room. And so, a computer mic just falls down and slides, like that. So, I've been using this H4n recorder from Zoom. And this thing is amazing. I guess it’s a field recorder that like journalists would use and stuff like that. But you can set the record angle between 90 and 120 degrees on the both end mics. You could plug in good mics to it too, if you want to go that way. But if you need to capture like an entire room, this device can actually do that. You can just pop it down and it will get your audio of the entire room which is like ridiculously handy. I think I have actually seen Confreaks use them in the past. They always have the mic for the speaker but then when they take questions and stuff, they have these recorders around and this is where they pull back from, I believe. Anyway, it’s a great recorder. It’s not cheap. But if you need to record a room full of people, it’s quite handy.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah. I love the zoom effect on it because you just set it on your desk and if it hears a sound wave coming in from either side, it cancels it out. And so, you can point it at the professor from 50 feet away. And it sounds like you're holding it right up to his face. It’s awesome.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Yeah. I expected the quality to be really crappy when I started trying it. But it’s way better than you would think. I'm in a room with this particular group that’s around 15 people, in this room, all talking and interacting. And it picks that all up surprisingly well.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; The other thing that’s cool about the Zoom is that or the Zoom H4n is that it has XLR plugs and basically every other plug that you would want on it. So, it’s almost a recording studio in a box. And you don’t have to use the onboard mics but like I said, it will record all of that stuff.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Everybody has one of this except me?** CHUCK:**&nbsp; I don’t have one. I want one. [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; I have a much smaller cheaper version of it. And if I could the bigger microphones, it would be so much better.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Yeah. [Crosstalk]**CHUCK:**&nbsp; Whoever’s sending David gifts, hint…hint. [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; You can tape a poop sticker to it. It’s fine.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Sounds like Avdi is the one who needs one. You go and send a gift.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Who’s that?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; I do all my recording into a digital audio recorder. I'm using the Edirol or Roland recorders. But there're definitely some features on the H4n that I envy.** JAMES: **&nbsp; It’s feature-rich, you can do everything, you can put it in this mode where it’s just a recorder but you get way better battery life out of it that way. The battery life is stellar consuming. It’s grabbing like full AIFF quality and stuff. I've just been like totally blown away by this thing’s ability to record a room full of people.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. It’s got a bunch of filters and stuff in it too. I mean, it really is kind of the topnotch handheld recorder.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Chuck, can you post links to the recorder that you said you used?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. It’s the one that I use, it’s cheaper. You can't get the Edirol R-09HR anymore but that’s because they have a new version. It’s the Roland R-05. It’s just as good. It looks a little bit different. It has two mics on it but they're not oriented the same way that the H4n are. And it’s relatively inexpensive and it’s really nice for like basic recording. One thing that I do with mine is it’s -- the Zoom H4n is actually quite a bit bigger than this is. And with this one, I’ll actually go for a walk and talk into it. I’ll just hold it up by my face. And I love it for that too. The other thing is unless I'm out and about doing a lot of fancy stuff where I kind of need the recording studio in a box, the Edirol works really, really well. And you can set it on in the middle of the table and you have a conversation with somebody and it works just fine. So, let me put a link in and then you guys can compare.** AVDI: **&nbsp; How expensive is expensive?** CHUCK: **&nbsp; The Roland is \$200. I don’t remember what the Zoom costs.** JAMES: **&nbsp; I can't remember. It’s been too long since I bought it.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Amazon has it for \$261.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Oh, really?** AVDI: **&nbsp; Yeah. It was priced \$609. So that’s -- looks like it’s getting old or something.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. The H4n has been out for a long time. And so, I wouldn’t be shocked if the…** JAMES: **&nbsp; It is amazing.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. I wouldn’t be shocked if they come out with a new version soon.** AVDI: **&nbsp; Gosh! Now, I wish I did more live recording.** JAMES: **&nbsp; I know, right? It’s good for that. It’s for doing a live show where we don’t have a good recording set up. Usually, Confreaks handles all the hard part for us. But if they don’t, then use this.** AVDI: **&nbsp; I haven't done a live recording in a long time.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; One other thing I want to bring up really quickly. I have a lot of people asking about my podcasting set up since we’re talking about this. I did a video. You can go to www.TeachMeToCode.com/ScreenCast/My-Podcasting-SetUp. I’ll put a link to that in the show notes as well. It’s a 20-minute video. I just walked through all of the equipment I have and what I use it for. So, if you want to know that, then that’s where you go. I actually did it because the guys at Lone Star Ruby Conference were talking about starting a podcast and they emailed me and asked what I used. So, I recorded it. I have equipment lists so you can look and see what you like and see what you don’t.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Speaking of Lone Star, make your plans now. It’s looking like a cool conference.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. Of course, they got some panel there. I just don’t know if I can deal with those guys.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Bunch of crazy folks talking about Ruby but the keynotes look really good. So, definitely check out Lone Star.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yeah. So, I'm going to throw another pick out there. This is something that Dave picked and I wind up buying one because I thought it was really cool and the Doctor Who Geek.** DAVID:**&nbsp; [Laughs] I know what this is!**CHUCK:**&nbsp; He was talking about the gift certificate or whatever he got at the Think Geek and it turned out that I had one too. I don’t know if it was from the same person and that probably was because I vaguely remember getting an Email about it. But I bought a Sonic Screwdriver. So, if you’re a Doctor Who like I am, then there you go. It does all the noises [noise in the background] and everything else. [Laughter]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; And so, it’s kind of a fun dude that’s set on my desk. If I'm sitting in a meeting, a client meeting or something, and I need to fiddle with something so I don’t lose track of the conversations. If I'm just sitting here at my computer trying to participate in a meeting and meetings aren’t always particularly engaging. Sometimes they are if you care about what they're talking about and sometimes they aren’t even if you care about what they're talking about. So, I have something in my hand that I can fiddle with, then it actually usually can keep me on task a little bit more because I'm not engaging in anything that actually requires my attention. I'm just fiddling with something that I can hold in my hand.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Plus it’s fun to point it at people. I mean, let’s face it.** DAVID:**&nbsp; You got one that doesn’t work? [Laughter]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; What?** DAVID: **&nbsp; You got one that doesn’t actually work? Derek Parkers was the guy who sent me my Doctor Screwdriver device. I want to give him at a shout out on the show because it is awesome.** JAMES:**&nbsp; He’s almost [inaudible].**DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah. Thank you, Derek. That was freaking awesome. The one that I bought has the blue one. It’s the 10<sup>th</sup> Doctor version. And because it’s blue, they put a UV LED in it. And so, the other end of it on caps and it’s got a UV marking pen in it. So, you can write things with invisible ink and then use the screwdriver to light it up.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yup. Mine is the 11<sup>th</sup> Doctor version. So, it’s green.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah, the green one.** CHUCK: **&nbsp;And if you uncap the end, it’s just a button that makes it turn up.** DAVID: **&nbsp; It’s really cool.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yup.** DAVID:**&nbsp; So, I’ve teased about this controversial pick and I realized that now I've kind of committed, right? Because people are going to be mad if I don’t. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; Do it! I'm not hanging up till you create some controversy.** DAVID:**&nbsp; Alright, alright. So, this is a call back to the only pick that I've ever gotten hate mail about. So, last year I mentioned Mosin-Nagant which is a 30-caliber firearm, the surplus from [inaudible]. And you can get it here for about \$100.**AVDI: **&nbsp; Did you seriously get hate mail for that?** DAVID:**&nbsp; I wouldn’t call it a hate mail. Somebody wrote me in and said, “Boy, it just kind of broke my heart because I'm kind of a pacifist and I just can't believe that you would want to promote this.” And we actually had a really good conversation about that. I said, “You know, I'm absolutely not promoting blood in the streets kind of thing. This is just kind of an American pastime, if you will.” And I say this is a controversial pick because of recent -- the current political climate and recent events. We’ve had a couple of school shootings. We had a couple of rampage shooting recently. And so, there’s kind of this national, I would say national discussion. There is a national discussion. Mostly what you hear though is national shouting at each other from opposite sides of the spectrum. And I am definitely not Gun Control, but I'm also not Gun Rights. I don’t take an extreme position either way. I'm painfully aware that the one thing that’s been proven to reduce accidental gun deaths is training. And there’s nothing in the constitution that says, “You must be trained before you buy a firearm.” But one of the things that can help people is just to have experience. And so, just to see, find out. A lot of people that don’t own firearms, don’t used firearms, they don’t play with them. And so, this next month, March 9<sup>th</sup> for a second Saturday, in March is Take a Newbie Shooting Day. I’ll post a link to it. There’s a nationwide kind of Facebook event circulating around this and if you’ve wanted to know more about firearms and know what does it feel like when a rifle kicks against your shoulder, is it satisfying or not for you to shoot paper targets, what is it like to shoot bottles or whatever your various range will allow and you want to know more about this, not presented in any type of political context. It’s just do you want to know more about this? March 9<sup>th</sup> is National Take a Newbie Shooting Day. And I just checked them out. They're currently, there’s nobody hosting in Utah. And so, I may look into helping address that. I think it would be just really interesting. If you're anti-gun, I totally understand that especially given recent events. I'm not going to try and start up a Gun Rights - Gun Control debate on a Ruby show mostly because I don’t really have an extreme position either way. And what that means is both extremes hate my position. [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; And so, I really don’t want to just catch it from both sides. But if you are interested in learning more about it, National Take a Newbie Shooting Day is on March 9<sup>th</sup>. That’s my controversial pick for the end of the show.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; Alright. I think we’re almost out of time. Let’s get to the picks. [Laughter]**DAVID: **&nbsp; And for our special pick guest today, we have…** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yes.** DAVID: **&nbsp; This is the part of the show where we bring somebody on to talk about something.** CHUCK:**&nbsp; There we go. [Laughter]**JAMES: **&nbsp; This is fun. I enjoyed just chatting about things with you guys. It’s kind of a Mini Topics Episode.** DAVID: **&nbsp; Yeah.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; Yup. Definitely some good stuff there, though.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Now, I have lots of new toys to go play with.** CHUCK: **&nbsp; You mean, you're going to go buy so many toys to play with?** JAMES:**&nbsp; Yeah. You guys are hard on my credit card. [Laughter]**CHUCK: **&nbsp; Alright. Well, let’s go and wrap up the show. I want to thank all the listeners for listening, all the panelists for paneling. And we’ll catch you all next week.** JAMES: **&nbsp; Bye everybody!** DAVID: **&nbsp; Cheers!** AVDI:\*\*&nbsp; Bye!
