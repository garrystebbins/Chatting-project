1:03 – David: Welcome! Today, Chuck is not feeling well. I am David and today we have Eric Berry on our panel today. It is just the two of us today. I want to talk about our development environment. What is your setup like? Do you have an office space and your hardware?

1:58 – Eric: I Have a room in my basement that has everything that I need. I do work from home. There is my guitar, my geek toys and more. For my hardware I am using 2017 MacBook Pro (16 GB of ram). The 13-inch is convenient, but I upgraded b/c I do a lot of traveling. I do pull the iPad out and use [DUET](https://www.duetdisplay.com). You no longer have to use a cord. I have a monitor that is 30-inches and it’s gorgeous. That is my hardware setup. I am not a mechanical keyboard guy, and I stick with the Apple super flat keyboard. I do use [Bestand](https://www.amazon.com/Bestand-Trackpad-MJ2R2LL-Keyboard-Included/dp/B07F6WXSWT) – it’s a holster for the keyboard and the track pad. What do you have?

4:35 – David: I have a Frankenstein setup. My needs change, over time, and when that changes my hardware changes. Back in the day I did not have a Mac and I used a Windows machine. I used to be a gamer, but then met my wife and then stopped b/c she didn’t like for me to waste time. My setup is more proper. I have a baseline iMac Pro b/c there was a great deal of $1,000 off. The other option was an iMac. I like the desktop b/c that’s where I do work – at home. It was a $4,000 investment. I am on my computer ALL the time it was worth it to me. I got the wall-mount for me, and I have more monitors wall-mounted, too.

8:00 – David: That is my monitor and computer setup. I have an eco-rhythmic keyboard b/c of childhood injuries. I have a really old Microsoft keyboard from 2005 something. It was cheap but I like the style of it. For my mouse I have a Logitech mouse. I love the feel of this thing. It has a side scroll left and right, and up and down. Especially when I am looking at code. It helps with my video editing, too. My mouse is my favorite to-date. I don’t have too much plugged into the Mac. I have a [GoDrive](https://www.goanywhere.com/managed-file-transfer/collaboration/godrive), which has everything on it – my whole life’s work is on there. If there is ever an emergency I know to grab that. Back things up in case of an emergency would be my tips to you all.

11:40 – Eric: I have struggled with backing things up actually. The problem that I have is that I am constantly moving my laptop. I have this guilt and fear of doing it wrong.

12:33 – David: I have this work laptop – I don’t back that up every day.&nbsp;

_David gives Eric his suggestions in regards to backing files up. David mentions_ [_Back Blaze._](https://www.backblaze.com)

14:05 – Eric: That makes sense. I live in the Apple eco-system. I have my phone, watch, 40 iPads, laptop – everything backs up to the Cloud. The date we are recording this is 10/30/18. Apple just announced a new upgrade. I feel like this could compete with an actual laptop computer.

_Eric asks David a question._

15:35 – David: ...My main problem with that is that you might already have a developmental machine. It’s a stationary computer then it’s not feasible to take on the go. I do have an [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/?afid=p238%257Cs4jbd50ah-dc_mtid_2092592t39165_pcrid_307875917033_&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-ipad-slid--) and I will take that on the go. I can login to my home network.

BLINK – I used on my [iPad Pro.](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/?afid=p238%257Cs4jbd50ah-dc_mtid_2092592t39165_pcrid_307875917033_&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-ipad-slid--)

_David continues to talk about his setup._

19:00 – Eric: I kind of agree with you. I have seen it used quite a bit. My brother does everything online for his job. The pros are that if you are training, and his company is configured that way. The pros is that you can code from anywhere on anyone’s computer. I am glad that it DOES exist. It’s not Cloud9 but someone does offer...

20:20 – David: I think going to a solo screen does hurt my productivity – working on the iPad vs. working on the computer. I could get faster and faster but only to a certain degree.

If you have the resources – then I don’t think it’s sustainable. However, if you don’t have the resources it’s better than nothing. At least you are coding and that’s important.

22:15 – Eric: I think of the audience we cater to with Ruby Rogues. I wonder if our listeners are strapped for cash or if they do have the resources to get the job done?

22:48 – David: If you don’t have a lot of money, you don’t have to buy a Mac. If Cloud hosting isn’t your thing there are different options. You have DOCKER, and use Windows as your main editor, and the WSL.

I wanted to do a test – I bout a laptop for $500-$700 and you can get away with doing what you need to do. Learning how to program and code with what you have is great!

25:00 – [Advertisement – Fresh Books!](https://www.freshbooks.com)

26:05 – Eric: Let’s talk about the software developer environment. Nate Hopkins isn’t on today, but you can’t change his mind – I am VEM all the way. I think Cuck is [EMAX.](https://emaxsoftware.com)

26:43 – Eric: What do you do?

26:45 – David: I use [VS code.](https://code.visualstudio.com)

_David talks about the benefits of using_ [_VS code._](https://code.visualstudio.com)

27:37 – Eric: Yes, 100%. I met the lead engineer behind [VS code.](https://code.visualstudio.com) They just made a new announcement.

I have been using VS code for quite a while now. The integrated terminal and other features are awesome. Pulling me out of [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) was a really, really hard thing for me.

29:28 – David: Sublime text, yes, but I got tired of the 40-year long beta, and the lack of expanding it, too. [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com) has won my heart over.

30:53 – Eric: My guess is that they are going to leave it alone. I am sure they will connect the 2 teams. Think of how much work has gone into [ATOM.](https://atom.io) That would be a hard pill to swallow.

31:20 – David: At the end of the day, though, it is a company. You don’t need 2 different editors when they do the same thing.

31:40 – Eric: I would have to disagree with you. Maybe they won’t merge the 2 but they just become different between [ATOM](https://atom.io) ([React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)) and...

32:22 – David: Why would a company cancel something only have 1 season? (Clears throat...Fox!)

32:58 – Eric: I open very large files with Sublime. Sublime handles this very easily. This goes back to: why am I opening up very large files?

33:31 – David: It’s a log file don’t lie.

33:40 – David: What browser do you use? Safari?

34:03 – Eric: Safari is nice for non-developers. Safari is lightweight and very fast. I have been a browser whore. I go from bedroom to bedroom from Opera to Firefox to Chrome. I fall into the Chrome field though. I have a problem with Chrome, though, and that it knows me too well. Google can sell my data and they do.

37:14 – David: With [BRAVE,](https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor) weren’t they doing something with the block chain and bit coin to reward you for browsing?

37:38 – Eric: Yeah I think that’s being run by...

38:03 – David: I still use CHROME b/c I like the extensions. It’s important to know why you are picking a certain browser. When you are talking about development you need to know who your target audience is. What kind of apps do you use?

39:54 – Eric: It’s interesting to see how much traffic the Android Browser gets. You want to switch over to other parts? For my tech software...I use [Polymail.io](https://polymail.io) for email. I use THINGS to keep me on-track, I use SLACK, BRAVE BROSWER, iTerm3 and MERT. I use FANTASTICO (calendar), and I use BEAR (for my note taking). What about you?

41:21 – David: I use [iTerm3](https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html), too. I’m on 3 different Slack channels. I have been using [DISCORD](https://discordapp.com). Other tools that I use are SPECTACLE (extension) among others. I try to keep it slim and simple, though. Another one is [EasyRez](https://www.easy-rez.com) (free download) and you can adjust the screen resolution on your desktop monitors. It’s important to target my audience better. I do like PARALLELS, too.

44:24 – David continues: Screenflow, Apple Motion, and [Adobe After Effects CC.](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoJmz46Df3gIVibbACh1r0QOXEAAYASAAEgIX9vD_BwE&sdid=KKQOW&kw=semgeneric&mv=search&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIoJmz46Df3gIVibbACh1r0QOXEAAYASAAEgIX9vD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!301433690360!e!!g!!adobe%2520after%2520affects)

45:04 – Eric: I use [1 PASSWORD](https://1password.com) and BETA BASE.

46:04 – David: Have you heard of [Last Pass?](https://www.lastpass.com)

46:15 – Eric: Oh sure! I have been using though 1 Password and I guess there some loyalty there.

46:54 – _David asks Eric a question about_ [_1 Password_](https://1password.com) _about pricing._

47:12 – Eric: I want to pay with money than with something else.

47:23 – David: It’s owned by [LogMeIn](https://www.logmein.com/pro/lp/sem-vert?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=lmi-semivert&mcomb=swDRAeh48%257C305846519682%257Clogmein%257Ce%257Ci8rbbhb5l0%257Cc%257C9259893037%257Ckwd-370197516%257C&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=%257BCampaignName%257D&Matchtype=e&adgroupid=9259893037&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrZ7emKDf3gIVybrACh3jvQUbEAAYASAAEgJ0U_D_BwE), and they have tons of experience with security.

48:00 – Eric: I am going to put an article here that compares all these different apps so you can see the similarities and differences side-by-side.

48:40 – David: Anything else? Banking passwords?

48:54 – Eric: Nah, I am excited to see where we are. I like [Mojave](https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave/) for the desktop but I don’t like it for the constant number of resets that I’ve had to do. I love what I do.

49:34 – David: Yeah, I agree. I haven’t experienced any major setbacks, yet.

49:55 – Picks!

50:03 – Eric: I think this whole episode has been PICKS!
