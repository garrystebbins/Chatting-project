**Special Guests:** Olivier Lacan

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panelists talk to Olivier Lacan about his blog post [_Why Won’t Bundle Update?_](https://olivierlacan.com/posts/why-wont-bundle-update/) and related topics. Olivier was originally a designer/web developer who fell into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) around 2010 and has been working on [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), which is sadly in the process of being shut down. They talk about what package managers are, where you would you see them normally in code, dependencies, gems, and much more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
