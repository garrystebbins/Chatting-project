<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:07 – <i>Chuck lists the panelists and the special guest.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:37 – Chuck: Why are you famous?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:41 – <i>Guest gives his background.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:13 – <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov"><span class="s3">Guest:</span></a> I am passionate about Emacs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:55 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:58 – Panel: I have on a few projects. Do you know RUFO? It’s a bit more opinionated than RuboCop. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:25 – Guest: I am familiar with RUFO and their approach is similar to JavaScript called Pretty or something like that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:45 – Guest: </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">4:49 – Panel: Can you tell us what <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop"><span class="s3">RuboCop</span></a> is and why is it important?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:00 – Guest: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few main things that <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop"><span class="s3">RuboCop</span></a> is: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1.) Placement for Ruby minor...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2.) Lint tool</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3.) Automatic checker for all the best practices outlined in the community</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4.) Formatter for Ruby code – you can feed it ugly code and it will spin out beautiful code</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:30 – Panel: What are the origins of the project? Where you interested in the performance and security aspects of it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:49 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest talks about RuboCop in detail.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:59 – Panel: It’s important to remember that these are just guidelines and they are NOT set in stone. Using single or double quotes. As long as the project is consistent and using decent practices then I am okay with the code. I will disable the...in RuboCop. Today with high-resolution monitors it’s one of those things that are an annoyance to me. It’s just my opinion, though. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:07 – Guest: Why disable it and not...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:36 – Panel: You could use VS code instead of Emacs! I am just kidding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:51 – Guest: I hope you are kidding! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:56 – Chuck: I cannot live without this code...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:06 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:26 – Panel: I was an early adapter from the beginning and it was hella slow. I tried it from sublime text and I got annoyed so I eventually switched to VS code. Once I got over the brand name, I really like it as my main editor. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:20 – Panel: Maybe it’s more approachable and it’s easier to dip your toes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:35 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:29 – Panel: I haven’t heard of <a href="https://komodoplatform.com"><span class="s3">KOMODO</span></a> in long time. I remember that was one of the first IDs that I had checked out. I tried that then went to Ruby Mine and then tried Sublime text and then VS. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:57 – Guest: <a href="https://komodoplatform.com"><span class="s3">Komodo</span></a> was a famous editor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:17 – Panel: I am curious on RuboCop that the adaption is driven by teaching idiomatic Ruby to people new to the language?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:40 – Guest: I don’t think it’s much about the stylistic stuff at this point. I also noticed that the main driver of the group was...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Guest goes into great detail about this topic. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:44 – Guest (continues): RuboCop offers a bunch of different structure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:27 – Guest (continues): We are wondering how to approach the issue of performance. The performance aspect tended to be trickier than what we had expected. The majority of developers when given the choice to either secure or make something convenient - they will choose the latter option. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:47 – Panel: That’s why they get hit with a high <a href="https://aws.amazon.com"><span class="s3">AWS</span></a> bill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:00 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:30 – Panel: The things you have learned with RuboCop, is it changing the direction with MRI or the design of the language at all?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:40 – Guest: I would hope so, but I don’t have hard evidence to prove this. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">If you give people too many options then it could be a waste of time. I don’t care about the nuances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:06 – <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/"><span class="s3">Ad: RubyMine!</span></a> 30-day trial! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:38 – Panel: Would you recommend the Rails style guide if you are building a Rails style project? Should we use that as a baseline and then customize it for your team?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:55 – Guest: The style guide should be good. For a while I was the only editor. Not a lot of the options that are there aren’t my personal opinion, but it’s the general prescription. If you have strong preferences and you have your team agree on those then it’s okay to be modifying it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">At the end of the day it’s better to have consistency within a project. You are doing great! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:57 – <i>Chuck asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:44 – Chuck: Could I modify a rule?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:53 – Guest: There are varying degrees to the rule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:56 – Panel: One of your conference talks you talked about the future of Rails and the future of other Ruby frameworks?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:18 – Guest: I am worried about the future of Ruby b/c I see people talking about the maturity of the system but there isn’t a clear vision to where we are going. There are some cornerstones for Ruby 3 that he is repeating. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:05 – Guest (continues): I think we need to commit to the module and the API. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:42 – Chuck: All of those things make sense to me. Is there any desire for people to fork Ruby or pulling / putting some of this in?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:00 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:18 – Panel: Transition that to Rails and the future of Rails?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:27 – Panel: There are big companies that are making changes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:51 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">53:33 – Panel: I think that is a common pattern that most companies move towards. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s4">54:12 – Chuck: <a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-020-phoenix-and-liveview-with-chris-mccord/"><span class="s3">We did an episode on ElixirMix with Chris McCord.</span></a> Check that out!</span></p>
