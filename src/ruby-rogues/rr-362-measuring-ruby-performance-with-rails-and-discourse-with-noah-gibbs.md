**Special Guests:** Noah Gibbs

In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panelists talk to Noah Gibbs about measuring [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) performance with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). Noah wrote a book called [_Rebuilding Rails_](http://rebuilding-rails.com/) and is currently analyzing Ruby performance for [AppFolio](https://www.appfolio.com/). They talk about how he puts benchmarks around Discourse, the 2 distinct audiences that come to Rails, and how Rails is constantly improving. They also touch on his life as a programmer leading up to being a Ruby fellow and much more!
