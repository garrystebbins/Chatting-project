## JSON Web Tokens, Authentication, and Authorization with David Kimura

On today's episode, Charles Max Wood and Jerome Hardaway discuss **JSON Web Tokens, Authentication, and Authorization with David Kimura**. David has worked on Rubies as well as for Sage Software for about 7 years.

## What is DriftingRuby?

David runs a short screencast site called [DriftingRuby.com](https://www.driftingruby.com/). It's where anyone can&nbsp;learn about Rubies through videos. What's great about it is it's currently free for everyone to use.

## Rails Devise Authentication

Devise authentication can come in difficult for some. But if you get into its core, you'll find it relatively easy. It uses BCrypt to store your password, takes it every time you sign in, and encodes it to see if it matches the hatch. This a secure way of authentication. The stronger the password you have, the more difficult it is to be hacked. One good thing about BCrypt is that it also keeps the salt between the password. It makes it irreversible, and changes over time.

## Configuration&nbsp;at Rails

Rails provides you the freedom to configure. So if you want to store a system&nbsp;or something else, you are free to do so.&nbsp;It depends on your situation and the type of application you're building.
