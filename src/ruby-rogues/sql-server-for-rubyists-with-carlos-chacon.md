## **SQL Server for Rubyists**

On today's episode, Brian Hogan, David Kimura, and Charles Max Wood discuss **SQL Server for Rubyists with Carlos Chacon**. Carlos is an SQL server enthusiast, managing partner of SQL Data Partners, and co-host of&nbsp;[The SQL Data Partners Podcast](http://sqldatapartners.com/sql-server-podcast/). Tune in to know more&nbsp;what he is currently up to and how his SQL knowledge would help Rubyists!

## **Why Choose SQL Server?**

SQL Server is a 50-year old technology which offers new features that are found in the data science space. In a 2015 report in analytics, it was mySQL that was the number one database at that time. This is because it was open source and that people can download users for free. Prior to 2016, there were already several versions that came out. In 2016, Microsoft made a big announcement with service pack 1, introducing features that are focused on the analytics space. These enterprise features are offered for free because its express version is free. As your database grows, you will have a better support and be able to use features that might not be available in some other environments.

## **SQL Server in Linux**

One big announcement Microsoft also had was the introduction of Linux SQL Server. The versions they currently support are Red Hat Enterprise Linux, UE Boom Two, and SUSE Linux. They continue to release additional versions of Linux which they will also support. You get all the versions, but what you only get, however, is the database along with its features. They can be installed or simply included with the SQL server. Examples are SQL server integrations services, ETL component, SQL server agent. These are not yet ported to Linux.

## **Transferring Data to SQL Server**

There are a billion and 1 different configurations right for your data. And they are found on the relational side, even in&nbsp;mySQLs. There are so many questions in the field, but they all boil down&nbsp;to what you want to do with that environment. You will see more data repositories, as they vary in so many ways such as functions focuses. The transfer of all data to SQL server solely&nbsp;depends on the project and the goals for the analytics.To hear more of&nbsp;_SQL Server for Rubyists_,\_&nbsp;\_download and listen to the entire episode.
