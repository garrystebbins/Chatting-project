<p class="p5"><span class="s5">0:00 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s3">Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:51 – <i>Charles introduces the panel.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:14 – <i>Nate talks about his background.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:27 – Chuck: My first programming job I worked with Nate. Nate also works now with Eric Berry. We have a special guest and that is Eric Oestrich. Tell us who you are, please! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:55 – <a href="https://twitter.com/ericoestrich"><span class="s3">Eric:</span></a> I work for Smart Logic, LLC. We are a consultancy who has moved to Elixir for the last 2 years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:14 – Chuck: Tell us what ExVenture is?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:46 – Eric: Late 80’s to mid-90’s it’s like a MUD tech space game. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Eric goes into detail of what ExVenture is.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:28 – Panel: Familiar with MUDS. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:36 – Panel: Audience can’t tell that Eric isn’t an old guy. Eric – you aren’t an old gentleman – how did you get into it?!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:02 – Eric: The concept has fascinated me. It’s pure game mechanics. In school I wrote things in Python and try to make it threaded. Never got it going. After that I wanted to do a MUD but not good enough in C and couldn’t get it working in Ruby neither. But one faithful day (a year ago) I got an echo and chat server and now we have a MUD.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:02 – Panel: Why should you be interested? I will tell you why. ExVenture is an open source...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I encourage everyone to dig into and play with it! It is a game (so that makes it more fun) but you are dealing with game mechanics. I am also curious where you wanted this to go? What made you say: I want to create this and make it open source?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:37 – Eric: I like it and work has mostly played for it. It’s MIT because of that. Early in the project (between client work) it was a common thread and that’s why it’s open source.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:27 – Panel: I ran into you at the conference and you were showing me...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Talk about getting metrics out of your system, please?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:20 – <i>Eric answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:09 – Panel: When people are trying to get metrics out of their system – what EVEN makes a good metric?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:21- Eric: I am trying to figure that out myself, actually. I want to know how long it takes for someone to login? Is that someone trying to hack into my system? If you speak at a global channel or something else...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Eric goes into more detail. Eric also mentions </i><a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus"><span class="s3"><i>Prometheus.</i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:31 – Panel: You mentioned: What would you want to see on a dashboard? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:01 – <i>Eric answers the question and mentions </i><a href="https://github.com/deadtrickster/prometheus.ex"><span class="s3"><i>Prometheus EX.</i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:19 – Panel: As you starting building this you were pulling libraries out of it and making them separate libraries. Are you pretty proud of <a href="https://gossip.haus"><span class="s3">GOSSIP?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:37 – Eric: Yes! <a href="https://gossip.haus"><span class="s3">Gossip</span></a> is based on web sockets and it’s a<a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy"><span class="s3"> cowboy</span></a> socket. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Eric talks about Gossip.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:10 – Panel: What other clients are you trying to support?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:15 – Eric: There is a JavaScript client and Node-based game called...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">There is a bundle system for that. There is also a Python option. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The one thing we haven’t done yet is a C client. That is important b/c most of the games that you could connect to are 25-30 years old.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:26 – <i>Panel asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:34 – Eric: That is the C client we are waiting for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:43 – Panel: You talked at the conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCUKQnkjajo"><span class="s3">(see the show notes)</span></a> you talked about things you learned along the way. Can you talk about your process? What kind of bottlenecks and how did you resolve those issues?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:10 – <i>Eric answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:44 – Panel: Did you run out of processes? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:47 – Eric: The VM shut-off – it was just done. That was the first go-around. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:27 – Eric: After the ElixirConf, I wanted to see how far I could push it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Eric continues.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:51 – Panel: I want to identify some of these principles you just talked about. First, the major block was the gen server is a single process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:21 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:24 – Panel: I think that is a common mistake when people come to Elixir in the beginning stages. How did you solve it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:50 – <i>Panelist answers the above question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:30 – Panel: That’s one of the big things. It’s an architectural issue. Second, you mentioned really LARGE messages. You were sending around really large messages. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:20 – Eric: For every 100 players was a gigabyte of ram – it was a lot. And that was mostly b/c every copy...when a new character enters the room then that message gets sent out then it gets copied again, and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:08 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:24 – Panel: The third one you mentioned was around data base blocking or...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Can you talk about this one a little more, please?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:33 – <i>Eric answers the question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:02 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:30 – Eric: It was always saving...I tricked Echo into saving...There is a lot of things that could be better to save specifically faster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:52 – Panel: I think people would hit those 3 points eventually – there is a lot of value to that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:09 –Eric: Yes that was near the end of my ElixirConf talk and my blog.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:23 – Panel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:33 – Eric: It came out in May and I figured out that I needed to learn how to cluster in Elixir. That’s what the ElixirConf was a bout from single node to multiple nodes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Eric continues.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:38 – Panel: When you have a cluster – and I join – when I transfer from one room to another room, I could be passed off to another server or node?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:01 – Eric: Whatever you mean by “being passed off.” Whatever server you land on that’s the one you will be on. The magic is that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:08 – Advertisement:</span><span class="s5"> <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com"><span class="s3">Fresh Books!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:15 – Panel: I am going through the code base now and I am excited. It’s going to help me get better at Elixir. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:32 – Eric: That’s the point of ExVenture. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:48 – Panel: You host a server so people can see what it’s about – and that’s Mid Mud, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:09 – Eric: Yep, the first hour of you playing. There is a town crier, you request, and then combat monsters. Also, it is plugged into Gossip and you can talk to them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:44 – Eric: Yep, there you go: player logged-in!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:55 – Panel: Maybe not b/c it will turn into a new podcast soon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:07 – Panel: What if I want to use Gossip, what is involved there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:16 – Eric: <a href="https://gossip.haus/docs"><span class="s3">Gossip.Haus/docs</span></a> – Go there! Set it up and start sending and receiving events. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:40 – Panel: When I was trying to understand the Prometheus metrics it helped. And then in downloading it (as a tip), for me, it was easy to use the DOCKER instructions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:32 – Eric: Yep, that was done by a community member.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:40 – Panel: Are you looking for people to contribute?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:50 – Eric: Yep, I have a public Trello board. There are 2 tags.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:12 – Panel: Sounds like you have people involved?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:22 – Eric: Bunch of people came on after the ElixirConf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:33 – Panel: If people download it (another tip) in the SEEDS file you will find out the admin username and password. I guess that’s something you can add. Login: ADMIN and Password: PASSWORD. What I thought was fun (playing with it) in the admin screen I got a sense that it’s generic enough that I could create a space game. Like playing with sectors of space. Does that make sense?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:42 – Eric: I don’t want it to be tied JUST to fantasy b/c that’s what MUD is. Everything should be good for historical/ fantasy/ etc. any genre that you want to do!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:13 – Panel: I could see a HackFest and the company could create one for their business. You could have a lot of fun with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:38 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:44 – Panel: Hidden things on their websites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:50 – Eric: Search TEXT ADVENTURE in Google Search. See show notes below.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:24 – Panel: There is a whole subculture that people are interested in and I didn’t know that these people existed. I think that is interesting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:45 – Eric: There are tons of games out there that are 20+ years old! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:55 – Panel: What is your favorite old school MUD game?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:02 – <i>Eric lists his favorite old school games! One of them is </i><a href="https://www.achaea.com"><span class="s3"><i>Achaea!</i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:51 – Panel: I like the status bars are really cool. If you haven’t played it you have a health bar. Also you have these expiring times and it’s very cool – modern MUD.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:22 – Eric. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:00 – Panel: You came from a Ruby background – what was your transition to Elixir like for you? How did you come to Elixir? What was that like for you? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:15 – Eric: Yeah some of my friends were into Elixir from a functional standpoint about 2 years ago. They were reading about Phoenix and such. They wanted to see how it was going to go. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:06 – Panel: Try by fire. Coming from Ruby to Elixir – what some advice would you give the same person?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:37 – Eric: It was less of a culture shock b/c Phoenix was still kind of “Railsy.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:35 – Panel: When I was first learning ERLANG, and telling them that it was a standard library. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:59 – Eric: It’s using Cowboys Ranch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:19 – Eric: There are a number of people out there that they want people to run to SSH b/c it’s more secure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:46 – Eric: I guess if we are on this topic about secure...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:40 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:51 – Panel: I think there is a lot of value, Eric, and the lessons you’ve learned and the path you’ve gone down. If you are new to Elixir going to ExVenture is a great way to start. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">47:20 – Eric. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">47:35 – Panel: Just run the format and we can do it that way. I encourage people to download it and see what it’s like as a user, and play with it as an admin. We have a <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetup</span></a> coming up this Thursday. Eric is coming in virtually into our <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetup</span></a> group. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:29 – Eric: Gossip is open source. Grapevine and Raisin – check these out, too, b/c they are open source, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:58 – Panel: Where can people contact you? </span></p>
