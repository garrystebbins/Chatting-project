**Special Guests:** Paul Schoenfelde

In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Paul Schoenfelde about deployments, distillery, and open source. Paul is an architectural engineer at [Dockyard](https://dockyard.com/) and was previously a .net developer for about 10 years. Since coming to [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), he has been dedicating most of his open source time and free time to the language and projects associated with it. They talk about how he got to where he is today, [Distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery), core release tooling, configuration, and much more!
