**Special Guests:** Sam Davies

In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Sam Davies about asynchronicity in Elixir. Sam has been programming for about six years and got into [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) about a year ago. Before working with Elixir, he was a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programmer and he currently works for a company called [Nested](https://nested.com/) and introduced them to Elixir there. They talk about asynchronous programming, different Elixir libraries, and his creation [Rihanna](https://github.com/samphilipd/rihanna).
