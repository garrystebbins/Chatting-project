**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Mark Erikson
- Eric Berry

**Special Guests:** Bobby Juncosa

In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Bobby Juncosa about his article [“Choosing Elixir.”](https://edgewise.engineering/choosing-elixir-5c1f4052dd28) Bobby is the CTO and co-founder of [Edgewise](https://edgewiserealty.com/), which is a new construction marketplace where builders can sell directly to buyers without the need of agents. They talk about how he got into using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), why Nuxt resonated so much with him, and how everything connects in his app. They also touch on dealing with web sockets, and the benefits to using them, where someone can go to figure out what he is doing, and more!
