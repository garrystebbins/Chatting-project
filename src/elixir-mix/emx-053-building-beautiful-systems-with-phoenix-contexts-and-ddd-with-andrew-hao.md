Joined by Special Guest: Andrew Hao
### **Summary**
Andrew Hao joins the panel to discuss a recent talk he gave; he shares his background and his origin story with domain driven design. Andrew introduces an exercise that helped him called “Context Mapping”. The panel discusses how to context map and the benefits of doing this exercise with your team. Andrew explains what to model as methods and functions in context style mapping. Andrew explains aggregate roots. The panel discusses using these design tools in GraphQL and Phoenix Live View. Andrew warns against overusing these tools, leading to a discussion about how much is too much.
