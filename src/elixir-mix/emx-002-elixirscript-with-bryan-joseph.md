In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel discusses ElixirScript with Bryan Joseph. Bryan works for [Revelry Labs](https://revelry.co/), has been a programmer for about 10 years, and has worked with[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) since about 2013. They talk about what [ElixirScript](https://github.com/elixirscript) is, why you would want to use it, and why he came about wanting to create it. They also touch on different open source libraries that he has created and the importance of usability.
