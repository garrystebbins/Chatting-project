0:58 – Chuck: Our special guest is Brujo B.! Let’s talk about the topic today, which is: Lessons from a decade of Erlang! We really haven’t talked about [Erlang](https://www.erlang-solutions.com) in the past.

1:47 – Mark: Can you give us your introduction, please?

1:55 – Guest: I started programming at 10 years old. I translated a guest to Spanish. Then after school I started working with other languages, until I did my thesis at the university. I got hired and then while there they taught me [Erlang.](https://www.erlang-solutions.com) After 2 years the company went away and died. When that happened I had my honeymoon plan to go to Europe. I went to Poland and found a company that interviewed me, I passed the test, and got hired. The best solution I could ever make. I moved from developer to another position, to director and then to CEO.

6:16 – Chuck: You have been doing [Erlang](https://www.erlang-solutions.com) for a while. My brain said 10 years of Elixir and that’s not possible – my bad. When Erlang came onto the scene how did that affect you?

6:40 – _Guest answers Chuck’s question._

9:06 – Chuck: See show note links, please. It’s cool to see that you took cautious approaches to the language. What’s the balance between Erlang and Elixir?

9:33 – Guest: It’s about 45/45, because I also do GO. I don’t really like GO, but it’s whatever.

9:59 – Chuck: What has changed in the last 10 years?

10:09 – Guest: It’s my personal view on this and what I see at conferences. I saw a change from beginning Elixir as much acceptance and the community is more open. The people are already so developed already.

11:53 – Mark: I know there is an effort to make the beam languages more compatible. I know using a colon in the name and there’s a lot of communication there. At the last conference, they were talking about this. I think it’s neat that the community is not fighting this. In the early days it seems that the Erlang community were fighting it – what’s that transfer been like?

13:00 – Guest: There were other languages outside of Elixir with the beam. They failed and didn’t catch-on.

15:00 – Panel: How have you liked/disliked coding in Elixir vs. Erlang?

15:14 – Guest: I like many things that Elixir and Erlang can offer. Elixir is a mature and young language. There are many things that they corrected from day one. One thing I don’t like about [Amber](https://amberframework.org) is that...

17:36 – Mark: I also use it b/c it does give that consistency. It normalizes all the different ways you can code. When I review people’s code I will take the code formatter and get it to be normalized. I am happy with it and I will take it.

18:17 – Guest: Everybody understands everybody’s code.

18:48 – _Guest mentions Elvis. See links below._

19:00 – Chuck: It’s interesting. It comes down to community and in some ways it’s not that Erlang community isn’t a good one, but sounds like...

19:17 – Guest: The other thing that happened with the Erlang community is the topic of building websites. In 2015 it was in the Elixir Conference in San Francisco – I think – this is what happened...

20:47 – Mark: I think it’s a credit to both communities. I’ve watched those talks before. I was watching these Erlang Conferences and there have been Elixir speakers there. Good collaboration and I’m happy for that.

21:19 – Chuck: Will these 2 technologies grow together?

21:30 – Guest: Great mix of talks from Erlang and Elixir and talking about how to build systems.

22:49 – Mark: This blog post that you wrote – see show note links before. Can you mention the main topics that you wrote within this blog post? General lessons you’ve learned?

23:23 – Guest: The most important is how we start building stuff over common abstractions.

26:07 – [FreshBooks!](https://www.freshbooks.com)

27:11 – Mark: You mentioned the behaviors and the abstraction that is available through OTP is through the[genserver.](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/genserver.html) Those are and yes it’s true to educate people you will start with a spawn to see how simple things are. Yes, you don’t build a system on that.

27:55 – Guest: I recommend the talk to Spanish speakers. See links below. I asked for a translation but he said no.

29:10 – Mark: You talked also about test-driven development. How has testing in the Erlang community from the past and how has it been influenced by Elixir if at all?

29:53 – Guest: I am not sure.

32:34 – Mark: I don’t know how to spawn another node and have a disconnect in a testing framework? There might be other ways to do it? I would like to borrow that between the two. I’ve built some code that is cluster aware. Yeah I would love to have integration tests. Maybe that is available through Elixir- thanks for talking about that!

33:27 – Chuck: Anything else? Let’s talk about the Sawn Fest!

33:40 – Guest: It started in 2011 and started with a contest that anybody could participate. Judicators judged it and then awards were given.

34:38 – Chuck.

34:44 – Guest: The next year in 2012 the sponsors gave prizes. We were eagerly waiting but there was no contest that year.

37:47 – _Chuck and guest go back-and-forth._

37:57 – Guest: There is a team of four now. If you go to the website it actually looks amazing unlike last year!!

39:19 – Mark: People will not hear about this, though, at the time it broadcasts b/c your episode is coming out after Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> - 25<sup>th</sup>. Can you do the game/contest remotely?

39:54 – Guest: Yes, people are playing from around the world from India, Denmark, Romania, Africa, and China! So yes you can do it from your house.

40:18 – Mark: What can people do or see or read about the winners? And after-the-fact?

40:32 – Guest: Yes when judges are judging we make the depositories public!!

42:05 – Chuck: My Sunday’s are usually pretty full.

42:19 – Guest: Yes that happened to me. As an organizer I cannot quit b/c I still have to be there. Time with my wife and kid is important, but yes it’s fun!

42:43 – Mark: Yes that shows how passionate they are about the community and the language.

42:56 – Chuck: Mind-blown!

43:10 – Chuck: You organize some conferences right?

43:17 – Guest: Yes.

44:25 – Chuck: Anything else?

44:30 – Mark: Dialyzer and curious about you organizing a Meetup? I have organized an Elixir Meetup. With Meetups how can you tell us how to make it successful? Are you doing both Erlang and Elixir? How are you running it?

45:10 – _Guest answers the question._

51:53 – Chuck: How can people find you?

52:00 – Guest: GitHub! Twitter! About Me! (See links below.)

52:19 – Chuck: Picks!
