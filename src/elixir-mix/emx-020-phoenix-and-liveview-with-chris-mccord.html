<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guest:</b></span><span class="s2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_mccord?lang=en"><span class="s3">Chris McCord</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_mccord?lang=en"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a> who created Phoenix and is an author, also. Chris McCord is a monumental developer within the community, and it’s exciting to see how LiveView is a great add-on to Phoenix, which is his baby. Finally, the panel talks about topics, such as Phoenix, LiveView, Elm, and Fire Nest. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1:21 – What are you famous for?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1:49 – Chuck: You created Phoenix. There is a new feature, LiveView, can you share with us what that is?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">2:08 – Chris: Sure. What got me started with creating Phoenix is similar to how I got into LiveView. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">3:13 – Panelist chimes in with his comments. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Panel: Questions we are asking: How to give the audience a high-quality experience without a huge overhead. When I watch this video on LiveView, I was freaking out. Are you glad you did it? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">5:01 – Chris: The response is really exciting and it really resonated with a lot of people. Often, I thought, working on past projects thoughts along these lines: “this was a huge waste of the day.” And I’m glad this was a good response. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">6:08 – Panel: Explain what you can do right now. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">6:18 – Chris dives into this topic. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Chris: We wanted to offer a rich experience. A lot of things we can target out of the box, with rich UI. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">8:20 – Panel: You announced this in your keynote in Washington D.C. The day before you hinted at it. And I thought: Is this even a good idea? Is this a misguided effort? If you have this first impression go, first, and see the video. You explain well your history and what you wanted with web development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watch this video to maybe not be skeptical.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">9:47 – Panel comments. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">9:50 – Chuck: I haven’t seen the video, yet. I am used to doing this with JavaScript. How do you do without JavaScript? Frontend?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">10:14 – There are pixies and sparkles, and Chris is bringing these sparkles!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">10:31 – Chris: It’s nice because we are piggybacking off the channel level. There is no JavaScript that you have to write today. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">11:16 – Panel: Question to Chris.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">11:31 – Chris answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">13:13 – Panel: Who else is doing this right now?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">13:15 – Chris answers question. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">14:51 – Panel: The original dream. Phoenix was just a stepping step to LiveView. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">15:08 – Chris: Those who are casting judgment – please watch the video. For years I have had this idea that I want to stay in the server-land...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">15:55 – Panel: It’s funny that your path unfolded the way that it did. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">16:28 – Chris: It blows me away. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">16:38 – Panel: I bet when you wake up your pants just attach themselves to your legs!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">16:57 – Chris: I work remotely, so...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">17:08 – Chuck: That got weird.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">17:18 – Panel: You’ve got a lot going on. When can we expect to see this? I’m sure you get that asked a lot. Phoenix 1.4 has to come first, and you are working on your book. While that’s going on you have a project called <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/firenest"><span class="s4">Fire Nest</span></a>. Sounds like you have a couple things you’re doing right now? How do you prioritize? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">18:08 – Chris answers these questions.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Chris: I do work full-time on Phoenix. Phoenix 1.0 is on my own time. This is at my own discretion. Whatever helps the community is good for them and for me. That’s how I do it without completing losing it. The book has been over a year delayed. It’s always a battle it’s a love/hate relationship. It’s hard when you when you want to work on exciting things like LiveView. The future, the things we want to build for. Some weeks it’s more writing, and some weeks its coding.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">20:01 – Panel talks about Chris’ team. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">20:25 – Panel: I got to ask you, I am more of a Ruby developer, and this thing that you’ve developed is making me lean towards Elixir. What’s your least favorite thing about Phoenix?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">20:56 – Chris: Never have been asked this before.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">21:06 – Chris: The thing that bothers me the most is maybe configuration? Lots of folks we did a lot of the configurations. I guess that has been a recent thing that’s come up. Even though, personally, I don’t have a lot of issues with it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">22:38 – Advertisement – Digital Ocean</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">23:13 – It’s hard to point out ugly features of your own baby.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">23:26 – Panel: You’ve talked about your rel. with DockYard, Inc. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">What’s that responsibility like?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">23:44 – Chris: I am a cheerleader for the company. I do work in a consulting role. This is good because I am solving real-world problems. I’d loose touch with that if I didn’t consult. The other time I try to help the team if needed. It’s a good mix for me. Writing Elixir code and not just framework code.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">25:02 – Panel: Umbrella project. Your rel. with your clients – when you would suggest an umbrella project or not? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">25:26 – Chris: It depends. It’s not so much code structure it’s mostly from an operational standpoint and not from a code structure standpoint. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">26:51 – Chuck: Give us a short history of Phoenix. How does LiveView tie into your vision with Phoenix?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">27:13 – Chris gives us his thoughts. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Chris: In 2013 – I fell in love with Ruby. That’s to show that it wasn’t on my radar to do anything else professionally. Never thought I would develop something like Phoenix. My wife noticed that I came home unhappy when I worked with Ruby at some point. She noticed a difference. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Chris continues to share the Genesis of Phoenix. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">It’s been a crazy ride. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">32:32 – Chuck: So it was mostly about the scaling. I’ve played socket IO, do some harm, then come back. Action cables are a little less of a pain. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Chuck continues his thoughts and asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">33:10 – Chris answers Chuck’s question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">35:00 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">35:14 – Chris. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">It’s interesting because you could have used a LiveView layer in the mid-2000s and nothing in town would have been able to compete.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">35:56 – Panel: One great thing about Rails is the integration. There is a path to it. Is there anything like that for the docket to build that for Phoenix? There is webpacker for Rails but is there going to be that for Phoenix.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">36:35 – Chris: No is the simple answer. It just works the way you would expect.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">37:46 – Chuck: The other one is partial JS. IT’s interesting because I go back and forth, too. I like the approach with JavaScript. I play with everything. I’ve been playing with an app recently and figured out how to do it in Brunch, because that’s what’s there. Why solve it the Elixir way? As a backend developer I may not want to mess with it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">38:51 – Panel: Another question about LiveView. From the video, from what I understand, is that the data that’s pulled from reads and rights?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">39:26 – Chris: I hope this doesn’t sounds like a cop out answer. My answer is that you will handle any system you are building it in Elixir. If you want to have durable state you would use existing tools that you have already. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">40:17 – Panel: The facilities you built around the LiveView, is it valuable for someone to...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">40:42 – Chris answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">41:22 – Panel: Another question on how LiveView works. Is that dependent on there being a JavaScript connection? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">41:49 – Chris: Answer to that is if you are...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">42:50 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">42:53 – Chris.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">43:29 – Panel: How is <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/firenest"><span class="s4">Fire Nest</span></a> coming along?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">43:38 – Chris: I won’t say it’s steady progress, but it’s coming along. We are working on it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">44:53 – Panel: That was exactly what I wanted to hear.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">45:00 – Advertisement. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">45: 42 – Panel: The new developments are happening outside of the community of Phoenix, right?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">46:07 – Chris: People think Phoenix is “heavy,” but it really isn’t. It’s really I want 80% and the teams and communities can build on top of that. Not in core. Not everyone needs X feature. No reason to shove it in core. It’s not about having it being “lighter.” I am developing resisting the urge to do it because someone says so.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">47:40 – Panel: Phoenix for me feels like it’s baked. There really isn’t anything that is lacking. It’s extensible. It’s done. That’s exciting. These add-ons like LiveView are a great plugin. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">48:23 – Chuck: How do people keep in touch with what you are doing and your projects? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">48:51 – Panel: Anyone on the team working with <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org"><span class="s4">Elm</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">49:00 – Chris answers this question. Elm has been on my radar, but haven’t gotten into it, yet. Not in the foreseeable future either. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">50:20 – Chuck: Picks! </span></p>
