**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Mark Erikson
- Josh Adams

**Special Guests:** Vitaly Tatarintsev

In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Vitaly Tatarintsev about Elixir and property-based testing. Vitaly is a back-end developer and who is currently still working predominantly with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) while he continues learns [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). He is fairly new to Elixir and likes to write articles about learning Elixir on his blog [_What did I Learn_](https://whatdidilearn.info/). They talk about what property-based testing is, where a person can get started with learning property-based testing, TDD with property-based testing, and much more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Vitaly intro
- Blog - [_What did I Learn_](https://whatdidilearn.info/)
- What is property-based testing?
- Run data to find etch cases that don’t work
- Are there tools for property-based testing?
- Not a lot of tools for this in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- [Stream data](https://github.com/whatyouhide/stream_data) library
- [Quick Check](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck)
- Used in addition to unit tests
- Where do you get started with property-based testing?
- Start with stream data library

- [_Property-based Testing is a Mindset_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84DMv8TQuo) - ElixirConf EU Talk
- How does property-based testing fit into the work flow?
- TDD with property-based testing
- Trying to implement Java applications
- Where has property-based testing helped you?
- [John Hughes YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfaNEebCDos&feature=youtu.be)
- Allows you to catch errors that you couldn’t predict to occur
- Helps you find cases you don’t think of
- What do you do when your property-based testing finds an error?
- And much, much more!
