### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of Elixir Mix, Chris Keathley introduces himself briefly and starts with talking about his work at Bleacher Report - a company specializing in sports culture - with respect to handling web traffic during major sports events and the implications of moving from Rails to Elixir as a backend system. He briefly touches on scaling issues, performance and the services they are running on their website. He then describes his Elixir journey until now and certain new areas he is working with, such as property based testing and distributed systems. He talks about maintaining the Wallaby library which is developed by him, mentions existing and upcoming exciting things in Elixir, and explains a few features of the Distillery and Vapor libraries. He also gives advice to people that are starting to work with Elixir on what must be learnt and more, and discusses certain projects and topics he wants to pursue and build knowledge in, in the near future.
