### **Summary** 
Anders Smedegaard Pedersen shares how he got into Elixir and his experience joining the elixir community. He shares with the panel his initial frustration with the community and his confusion on the “correct” way to do things. He tells the panel of his experience at elixir conf meeting Claudio Ortolina, the advice he got, and how this led him to his first nerves project. Mark Ericksen and Josh Adams give advice to new elixir developers. The three of them compare umbrella structure and poncho structure.

### **Picks**
 **Mark Ericksen**
- Set a larger goal (like 30-day goal) and do something every day to move you toward that goal. Even if only 10 minutes. Keep your momentum.
