In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Osayame David Gaius-Obaseki. Osa is a software engineer at a company called [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-5Xms7nP3AIVSNbACh24hQhoEAAYASAAEgLxEfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CL7SmrW5z9wCFYfcwAodRycBRg), is originally from Nigeria, and has been writing [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) for a couple years now. They talk about his talk, [Why Elixir Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmUtemvokSk), how he came about writing this talk, and lambda calculus.
