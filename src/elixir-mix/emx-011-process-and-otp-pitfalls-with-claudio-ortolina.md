  **Special Guests:** Claudio Ortolina

In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Claudio Ortolina about Process and OTP pitfalls. Claudio works for [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/) where he is a developer consultant, working with customers on long projects, and he has been working full-time with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) for the past 3 years. They talk about OTP, the importance of reading the sources when working with Elixir, and if beginners should dive right away into OTP. They also touch on [Process](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/processes.html), how Elixir allows your code to be more available, and more!
