06:09 - **Q1:** Do you group your products / services into one big site to pool traffic, or do you think its better to build them as their own brands?

17:39 - **Q2:** As a freelancer, a designer has a portfolio. As a programmer, do you think your blog / user group and conference speaking says enough? Or, do you need to have [<u>Open Source</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) to help backup your work? Obviously, it depends if the person hiring knows what [<u>GitHub</u>](https://github.com/) is or not. I'm thinking about screencasts to add more visible portfolio items since it’s not easy to show code by itself. Thoughts?

27:29 - **Q3:** If you are preparing to go freelance, you're wanting to show you're an expert and build clientele. You have some good long-term customers for the existing business. How do you recommend getting a testimonial from them that you could use while at the current business, and when you go freelancing, without compromising the business relationships? Do you try to steer clear of any links to old work, or just direct them to [<u>LinkedIn</u>](https://www.linkedin.com/) so that it’s obviously linked to you and avoids complication?

35:20 - **Q4:** My thought is, if you do blogs, create screencasts, and are active on [<u>GitHub</u>](https://github.com/), etc., it would put you in the top 10% [of developers] right there though, right? Most developers are “dark matter developers”: you can't see or hear them, but they're still there.

42:53 - **Q5:** Should you import your old blog posts from old websites to new ones?

51:43 - **Q6:** What about [<u>Content Marketing</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing) and [<u>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) with having so many sparse sites? Versus pooling?
