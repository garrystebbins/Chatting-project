## Working with Designers without Wanting to Kill Them

On today's episode, Philip, Jonathan, and Curtis discuss about&nbsp; **Working with Designers without Wanting to Kill Them** with&nbsp;James Stone. James is a Design Systems Engineer, and is top contributor to the open source ZURB Foundation. He also teaches at Penn State University. Tune in!

> “I've had experiences in the past where I've worked,&nbsp;where a designer would be so caught up with their idea in a&nbsp;design that they'll just root for it and push it through no matter what the cost. Sometimes that ends up being a lot more engineering time to accomplish more less the same thing.” -James Stone

He is mostly known for his [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/JamesManOfStone). At present, he also teaches an online course for scripts at Penn State University.

## Into Programming and Design

James has unique story on how he learned programming.&nbsp;His mother was a clinical microbiologist.&nbsp;She taught him how to program, and took him to the lab to look through the microscopes. Programming eventually became his career. Started working for some startups in Seattle. After awhile, he went back to school and studied art and design.

## Designer vs Developer
