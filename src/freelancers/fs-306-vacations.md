 **Panel:**

- Reuven Lerner

In this episode of the Freelancers’ Show, the panelists discuss vacations. They talk about the importance of taking time off for yourself, the fact that your business won’t fall apart if you take a few days off, and the unhealthy cultural baggage that makes people feel as if they can’t take a vacation. They also touch on the fact that it’s okay not to squeeze out every cent you can out of your business if that means you can live a happier life, how to set boundaries with your clients when you go on vacation, and more!
