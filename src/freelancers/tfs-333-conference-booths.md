### **Episode Summary**
The panel discusses the advantages of having a booth at a conference. Having a booth at a conference is a great way to learn about how conference advertising and finance works. It is also a great way to network and collect leads. Reuven talks about his experience at getting a booth at [Pycon 2019](https://us.pycon.org/). He shares tips on what to give out at the booths such as flyers and t-shirts and how many to order and in what sizes. He talks about the best way to work out the logistics for the materials for the booth and tips on attracting visitors to the booth. One takeaway Reuven had for his next booth was to have more Medium sized t-shirts made! Listen to the show to learn about more tips on getting a booth at a conference and the best spot to place your booth at the conference job fair.
