## Choosing Content Marketing Topics

Today's episode features **Choosing Content Marketing Topics**. Content marketing is everywhere.&nbsp;It helps boost a startup's reputation, and&nbsp;encourages meaningful content in the community. But, what does it typically requires? How can someone go about choosing topics? Tune in!

## What Content Marketing Is

Content marketing includes blogging and podcasting. Look around you and you'll find content through brochures, television, radioâ€”almost everything. But, it is not advertising. According to Philip, the idea behind content marketing is to create something that you hope has value. You create free value that people follow, and make a sale out of that value you presented.

## Sales vs&nbsp;Marketing

Reuven usually confuses sales with marketing. Sales is directly offering something, and getting paid for it. On the other hand, marketing is more about demonstrating so that you can make a sale. Content, such as blog posts and email courses, improves the authority of the brand concerned. That empowers that brand to make an easy sale.

## Not a Free Craft

Content marketing requires time and energy.&nbsp;It may not come as easy as some expect. It requires you to create something that search engines can index. That&nbsp;eventually would connect you to a potential client or lead. You may find it lucrative if you have the skills and the time. That way, you wouldn't have to pay someone else. You get to enjoy your profit completely. But again, the act itself is not free. It requires time and energy to produce something valuable. Startups can benefit from it since it can boost their reputation. **Download and listen to the entire episode titled _Choosing Content Marketing Topics_.
