## Increasing Monthly Revenue

On today's episode, Curtis and Reuven&nbsp;discuss **Increasing Monthly Revenue** &nbsp;with Jason Resnick. Jason is a web developer, freelancer, and consultant. He specializes in establishing e-commerce businesses, aiming to help&nbsp;entrepreneurs and freelancers increase their sales by strategies and implementations. Tune in to learn more how to increase your monthly revenue 10 times in 6 months!

## Changing Gears in Business

At the beginning, he was unsure of what business he really wanted to focus on. He figured out how to satisfy his clients as far as problem-solving is concerned. The idea of leveraging his client-based business to build recurring revenue came to him around 2013. As any other developer, he doesn't enjoy phone calls. However, mutual communication with the clients was the only way to know which direction a project is headed. By setting up 10-15 minute phone calls, he gained the revenues he wanted.

## Relationship with Clients

Jason enjoys working with his e-commerce clients and learning from them at the same time. He checks on which areas his clients were struggling with online, and directly manages the implementation of strategies in making new features, improving check-out flow, and learning about&nbsp;their customers. He came to realize that there are similarities among his clients. To come up with effective strategies, &nbsp;he concerns himself with how well he knows his clients, how their site's design is like and how it functions, and how check-out process can be enhanced.

## Outsmarting Opponents

Clients pay him more because he's capable of bringing back profit to their business. He doesn't look at colleagues other freelancers in the market with how much they charge. He outsmarts them by positioning himself against their own business, which makes things easy for them. For instance, his fee that is worth $2,000 is a no-brainer for them if he is able to bring back $10,000 in a month. That's what he learned what to do in the long run. He sees this method more advantageous rather than monitoring the hourly figure that the market is bearing at a particular point.**Download and listen to the entire episode titled&nbsp;_Increasing Monthly Revenues_.
