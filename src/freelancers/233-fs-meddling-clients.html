<h3>Transcript</h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:         Hi everyone and welcome to episode 233 of the Freelancers’ Show. This week on our panel we have Philip Morgan.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:           Hello.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And Jonathan Stark</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rueven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m Reuven Lerner. Jonathan, why don’t you describe what we’re going to talk about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this week?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, great. There’s this Seinfeld Clip for this certain Seinfeld Clip episode, there’s a clip on YouTube called the Indecisive Carpenter, which you can Google for. To be honest I haven’t seen the whole show but this segment, about a minute long and Jerry has hired a carpenter to come in and redo his kitchen. It starts off with Jerry sitting in his tables, he’s trying to do his bills and the carpenter keeps interrupting and he’s like, Jerry listen, do you want this hinge or that hinge? And Jerry’s like, “It doesn’t matter, either hinge.” And he’s like, “Well, they’re not the same thing. This and this like this, this and this like that.” Jerry’s like, ‘I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t care. Just pick either one.” The guy looks at his hands and Jerry says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">left and so the guy’s like okay, he used the left hinge. Then the cuts to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">another scene where Jerry’s trying to leave, he’s trying to go out with his</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">friends and the carpenter is like, “Jerry, Jerry before you leave I just want</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to ask a couple of questions about…” And Jerry interrupts and he says, “Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">finish it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hilarious logical extreme of what I see so many developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doing with their clients, designers too. Designers are famous for this, where they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are invading the clients into the sausage factory way too much. I used the clip</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to illustrate that sort of morale or I was like you be the expert, you do. Don’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ask your customer’s opinion or your client’s opinion about which hinge to use.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t know. You have to educate them about the differences between the two</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hinges and how you’re wasting their time and you’re wasting your time because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately they’re going to do what you recommend anyway. Just do it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I found myself, as I drilled into this topic a little bit more, because I set it up my list and wow, it really touched a nerve. Lot of people almost angrily emailing back like so my clients shouldn’t be involved at all in the decision making process? Things like that. Because people are billing this and they can’t imagine what else do we do, what they would do instead. So they’re like, what else would I say? I cannot ask what hinge to use o which font to use or what color to use or how big to make the logo or where to put the button or how big to make the button, if they like this or if they like that and most people probably do this and think that is what we’re talking about when often advocate having a lot of client communication but I think that’s a mistake because really what you’re doing is asking your client for uneducated opinion that you are far more qualified to provide. If you just do the thing, you pick the hinge, you pick the logo size and so and so forth, just do it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you get to a point that you are developing you design, you’re like I wonder if I should do this or this? Just do one. And then if you really want to in your design review, I wouldn’t even bring it up. In your designer view you can just present it and if they say, “Why do you go with that hinge? Why’d you go with that color? Why’d you go with that font?” Don’t ask them in advance. Just present what you think is the best thing and if they bring it up and maybe you can have a discussion, maybe they are educated on it. But I would even move farther and say you shouldn’t do that but let’s baby step here.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for today’s show is start there and have a conversation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">around what sort of input should you be getting from your customers when you do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a designer view or have weekly stand up. And what shouldn’t you ask. And of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">course how does that translate into your career, your fees, in making your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business better growing, that sort of thing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Client communication is always crucial, you want to be talking to them all the time. It sounds like  what you’re talking about is, there are certain things that you should be communicating and there are certain things you should not be communicating. You should not be asking for, I like the way you describe the uneducated advice or uneducated opinions. You are the expert. And yet I feel like in many cases, if it’s on the software the software side, right? Because I am a developer and so forth. They come to me and say, you know I’ve heard this no SQL thing is really great. You should be using MongoDB for everything. I definitely have sort of opinions and arguments against that. That’s the sort of thing where I feel like they should have no opinion. I’m not just so that I could ask them. I don’t think anyone have ever challenged me on that sort of thing. That said, there are plenty of these especially when it comes to design. I definitely could see they have strong opinions and they will express them, and they want the website to work on this certain way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A client has literally never come to me and said, you know, we organized a Git repost, seems a little strange to me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:        I know that. It doesn’t happen. Or you’re building an API, it doesn’t happen. Developers are insulated from a lot of this because a lot of their work is below the water line. Once you get above the water line, where most designers are operating, some frontend developers. Developers definitely inhabit the space, you get opinions and we’ve talked about this in many shows.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the project even starts you need to set goals for the project. We need to agree with the customer or the client what the goals are. This would be business goals not goals like finish this feature list, implement this feature, that’s not a goal. It’s not a business goal. You want to get business goals from the customer or the client and once the project starts and somebody says, “You know I’ve been hearing a lot about MongoDB or could you make the logo bigger. Either you say, why? You make them make a case. You don’t bring it up, do not bring it up. Do not say, what do you guys think about a [00:06:31]? What do you think about the size of the logo? Do not bring it up. If they on their own bring it up, you ask them why they brought it up. If you are really the pert and they really aren’t, which is usually the case. They’re the expert on their business. They’re not the expert on what you do. If they do bring it up, and you are the expert, you won’t be able to make a case. You can say, I don’t see how this achieves a project goals, you don’t have any kind of argument how this achieves the project’s goals. Let’s put this on the back corner and focus on the stuff that we know achieve the project’s goals. If we have time and money left over later, resources left over later, we can either ab test these things or put them in or we can put them off for a phase too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the key I think to managing scope creep is to have business goals to find and not ask them for their opinion on stuff that you are the expert on. They’re paying to do it, that’s why I thought the Seinfeld episode is so funny because Jerry was so annoyed, the customer is asking for his input. He’s asking Jerry to make decisions that Jerry was not qualified to make. And I think if we will just do that as almost the defense mechanism, you told me to use this hinge. Well, the door’s falling off. You’re the one that picked it. By the hour you can get away with that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I can see both sides of this. I am going to throw out a situation that occurred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to me earlier on in my freelance career and I really would love you guys input</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on this. I cannot my build myself as a technical writer when I started out,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that was my market position. That’s how I describe what I did. As a result, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kind of gigs that I would get, I would kind of feel the backup plan and here’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what I mean by that. With writing as a little bit unique this way, I think it’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">certainly different in software development, although this shows up also in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bigger companies you as a freelancer feel like a backup plan because you’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doing something that the client could do in house and probably would if they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have the bandwidth for it. like I would get hired or write a white paper for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">example and maybe this is kind of me projecting my insecurity on the situation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but I often have feeling that a client would do an in house if they had the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">time, if they had the capacity if they weren’t under the gun for big product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launch or whatever the specific situation was. It would have one of their in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">house subject matter experts to it and they’re off to the marketing department</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to be polished and I will never have gotten hired for that. For me that create</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this but again the insecure feeling of like oh gosh I really needed to do it to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their specs like they’ve designed the blueprint and I’m the carpenter in here</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who’s executing on it or the assembly line worker who needs to follow the spec.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that really led me to feel like I needed to get a ton of client input all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the time throughout the project.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">       </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. That’s totally fair. What you’re describing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the developer world is staff augmentation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Right and it’s a fine way to pay the bills and keep the lights on but it’s no way to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a business. If you’re going to do that to just get cash flow and you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be the employee just like the economic sort of slightly difference so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they don’t see the need when you’re long term. You’re basically behaving as an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee where you need to get the approval of your manager at all times. It’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understandable for people who are in that situation are be confused by what I’m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying with the carpenter example.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">                      Once you have that base line of financial security and you are looking to grow your income profits and your revenue you want to start saying things like client comes to you and says hey we want you to write this with you and you want to say why? That’s the goal of the white paper. And you’ll probably say shut, hang up, see you later, we’ll just get someone do it for us. But a good prospect for you or someone in that situation would be like the reason that we want you to make papers were trying to attract leads to the website. How many leads you want to attract? While you’re looking to do it. At the end of the conversation you have done a diagnosis of their melody so they have some either some opportunity they want to capture, some problem they’re trying to solve. If you just say okay, I’ll write the white paper for you without finding out what the melody is or what the opportunity is. Doing the white paper it changed nothing meaningful for them. If you want to move into that realm, it’s farther from freelancer and closer to consultant or visor and you want to start asking those questions. I don’t thinks it’s really push back</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were just asking questions like maybe the white paper is the best approach.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just want to make sure before I write this thing for you that your money that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you spend with me is going to be a good investment to you because in that will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be longer relationship for both of us. And they might say we really just want</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to get more leads and if you have somebody to do that we’re all ears. That’s a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">good client, possibly a good client. Okay, I get some of their ideas about</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this, I’ve been doing this for five years. Or maybe you could just spend a few</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bucks on Facebook as in be done with it or whatever. And head them from a more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultative approach.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. I’m glad you said that. I’m trying to imagine what the folks at home are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thinking. You’re not likely as a newish freelancer or you’re new to this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">approach, they’re not going to say let us set up a meeting with the CEO for you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the CEO has just some questions for you. They may just say well, we just do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what we always do in our product launch. We just always write six white papers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to support the product launch or of course we want to sell more products but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">even getting that kind of answer, even if it’s not the right answer or the best</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">answer for those kind of why question. It’s incremental progress in your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">movement out of being a hired pair of hands and towards being access to your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brain which is where, as we all know, where the real money is, right?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And figuring out and getting better and better at working your way up to the true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision maker. Because you’re right. If you’re just starting, it’s highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">likely that the person attempting to hire you or hiring you toward the white</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper, they don’t know the answers to these questions, some are just told them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do it and they don’t want to tell you to do it so they can get it off to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their to do list so that in their weekly meeting they can yeah, that’s someone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing the white paper. They don’t know why. That is not a good relationship,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s not good, that’s too vague. It’s not a very profitable relationship for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">either party. To push for greater wealth creation for all involved, you can ask</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">questions to a person like this, who if they’re having a good day will indulge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you and say you know that’s a realty good question but they really don’t know</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the answer. And in a good situation, you could say, who does know the answer? I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t really want to take this on not knowing if I really helped the overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business. It’s difficult but you can try to work yourself up the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entrepreneurial chain of commands must speak to get those questions answered.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois has a pretty specific advice on this where he got this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">two stage approach to it. One where he just sort of says like what I just said,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well if you can answer these questions, you can and then if the person wants to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">act like a gatekeeper and sort of prevent you from talking to their superiors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">then you can say something like well, if this project goes probably wrong, you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kid of threaten them. It’s not going to be my fault, it’s going to be your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fault.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think either one of us wants that. So I think it’s in your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best interest to let me talk to your boss. He’s operating, he’s not writing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">white papers. He’s operating on a different level, of course. I don’t think it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">matters what level you’re at, as long as you have this understanding, this sort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of world view, this mindset that could be your head. Don’t think of yourself as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone who writes white paper, think of yourself as someone who solves a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">particular problem and you happen to do it by writing white papers. And focus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the problem that you’re solving from the business and come up with the other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ways that you can solve it or further up the value chain. Takes time to do it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course but you want to get to a point, I have to put some really good words</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the mouth of the thousands of listeners but personally you’re listening to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this because you want to make your business more profitable and the way to do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is to go further of the value chain. You’re going to do that is to ask why</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you want to do certain task and to do that, you would probably lose out on some</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">work. Eventually, you’ll start getting better work for better and better</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clients. Like before, create this baseline of income where you’re trying out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">white papers and you’re asking what chains to use. But the while trying to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attract better clients while you have these keep lights on gets going.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[00:15:58] their clients further up the food chain to grow your business and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually you can stop doing the [00:16:04] work stuff. And do more advisory</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">type of engagements.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a major mind shift and I think it’s only recently that I understood a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely. The difference between a consultant and an employee is not just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re paid differently, it’s not just leader relationship. Is that you being</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call as an expert on very specific thing and so it’s normal for me to go to my</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant and say and ask questions about how should spend money, save money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and so forth. I’m going to ask him those questions. I have a dialogue about it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right? But I’m not say have this types form, have a bad tax form. First of all,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the day that I do that would be a crazy day. You know what it’s like? It’s like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">those people go to their doctor and the doctor says well, I think you have such</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and such. But I read on the internet. The difference is that with a real</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultant, with someone who’s bringing authority there, they’re coming in for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that sort of advice which is wildly different mindset wise, then what have on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an employee and so as an employee, yes you always have to be checking with your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">boss and making sure it’s the right thing because it’s the boss’s name who’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going on it. It’s the boss who is responsible for because you’re doing the work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but their name is on it. And here, it’s your expertise, it’s your ideas and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re name is on it. And if it doesn’t work out well then you’re out not them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You still have those conversations, I mean Jonathan, you said at your podcast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at some point, by the way I’m forgetting his name, you guys have been doing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">value based [00:17:50] for a long time. I just read the interview with them,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s great.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron Baker.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron Baker. I think you gave the example like when you go to your doctor, you’re not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to tell them how to do the open heart surgery. That really clicked for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">me. And yet so often it’s so easy to get sucked in that kind of conversation,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right? You want to still please the client, you want to make them feel like you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">care about their opinion because you do. That’s a fine line to some degree in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">many cases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I love the accountant example. Because I imagine that most people are not into, they don’t have this earning desire since they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were a little kid and to like be all up in their own finances. It’s one of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">those things that’s highly personal, it’s very emotional, their money and what</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it can do for you and what enables you to do or not do, or lack of it that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent you from doing. My relationship with my accountant is just like what</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you described, I say I describe my situation, I got this many kids, they’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this old, my wife blabla. This many cars, office. What should I do?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask the client relationship that you want to foster as a freelancer moving into</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consulting round. You want to find client who’s going to look at you and say,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s my situation, what should I do? Not look at you and be like, client</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks at you says, “Do these 15 things.” That is the thing that will pay the bill</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for you because you know how to do those 15 things, you know how to create a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reactive [00:19:26]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to slice a photoshop document and so on and so forth. Recognize that those things are never going to get you anywhere you need to move away from those things if want to increase your income. You love those things, your craft, you labored over them, you have a sense of mastery over those things, they’re not going to get you to the higher levels of income, those things. You need to transform those mastery into advice. Your understanding of how photo shop works or what’s possible with react or even in a web browser in general. That expertise can translate into advice. Where people are like we have this high risk situation, our competitors are destroying us, we know we have to undertake this massive redesign, if we screw it up my head is going to roll and probably the business is going to go down under. We need somebody who we can look at and say here’s our situation, what should we do? And you tell them, and they do it. Learning PHP or React or photoshop or illustrator leads to that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what I did. I started out with PHP and work my way up to do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that, do this. And I tell that to a  lot of people and they freak out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because they’re absolutely in love with their craft and having the semi colons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and keyboard shortcuts for photoshop and so on and so forth. Eventually, if</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don’t leave that behind, you’re going to hit that income ceiling very</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly and it’s going to be around $140,000 and that’s you’ll ever make the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rest of your life for a year. If you want to go that $140,000 ceiling, you have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to go up a level and use the expertise that has accumulated from while you’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doing the sort of implementation things.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">What about when the client wants to be involved more? Let me just give me examples. I work for them in years, I really love them, they’re great people, interesting and everything. And they’re on a market where Airbnb is sort of a similar market. Not exactly but some more. Whenever we bring in design, I’m not the designer at all, so this does not affect me directly. One of them would be like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well, this is not like Airbnb, and he’d be like they have so much more money,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they have so much more markets space, they have spent time researching it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that whatever Airbnb is doing is the right thing to do. We just make</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a book like them. They have bigger photos, we shoot bigger photos. They have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">down the line and so</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re working like that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Often times I get that in sort of Facebook area where somebody else client will say,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well Facebook done all this user research, we should just copy whatever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision they made about the hamburger menu or how to do a navigation or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whatever. My answer to that is always, you’re not Facebook, you’re not even</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">close to Facebook. Now these guys they are close to Airbnb or they’re trying to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be but I would ask without presuming the answer, I would ask is copying</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb’s design really the fastest way to the goals that we’re trying to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">achieve here? What are the goals we’re trying to achieve, Airbnb is not a goal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must have specific business goals or hopefully they have specific business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">goals and it’s highly unlikely that copying Airbnb’s design is going to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically work to get them to these goals. Like you can see why someone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would think that. It will look like Airbnb. What if we make it look like craigslist,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what’s our competitive differentiator?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument is a little more serious, the area was not just like aesthetics. The argument was, they’ve done AB testing and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they’ve published on their blog. That doing aesthetics wise and more effective,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thus let’s just take that research and go with it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s like somebody else to do work for free.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I said, I wouldn’t presume to know what the correct answer is but I would run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any design decision regardless of any decision or anything that they are sort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of any place where it feel like the customer is trying to do your job for you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or micromanage you or something like that. I always say the same thing. I say</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what’s the business case?       </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to do integration with segment.io. What’s the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">case? Well, we’re trying to get the single for all our leads to be collected,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">why don’t we send it them all in [00:23:59] integrate with it. Oh we can do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that? Yeah, we can do that? Yeah, just do that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think you’re doing your customer and yourself this service if</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you skip over the diagnostic phase of any request. They make some specific</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">request, use that hinge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright. We can totally use that hinge. Why do you want to use that hinge? Why do you even care which hinge we use? I thought that you just care that your kitchen was better for entertaining lunch parties? Yeah but I read this thing on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[00:24:27] that said that that hinge is a blablabla and then you might say,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whatever. Those get in my nose, you can use whatever hinge that you wants. Or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you could say, you know, this hinge actually is five times more expensive than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the other hinges and you got 45 of them in this kitchen. Which means that we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can afford average hinge if you want to stick to the budget. It’s kind of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority thing, resource wise. Would you rather have this hinges or the average</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hinge or we want to increase the budget? You got to keep them honest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like when I’m in a project, there’s me, there’s the client</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and there’s the project. Project’s like this other entity that both of us need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect and effect to me protecting it. And at the end the idea is that I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to be a gigantic success because that’s how that customer’s going to gauge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their satisfaction with me. We need to know upfront what success looks like and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">then by hook or by crook into the nail brought the project, I do everything</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I can in my opinion that’s going to keep the project on course. You ask me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for something that I think has no effect one way or the other, I’ll just do it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but if think it’s going to have a major impact one way or the other, I’m going</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to raise that issue. And say look, this is a tradeoff. Somebody says, we want a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">classic one with flame design. There’s are always in the middle of the project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying [00:25:54] more analytics, [00:25:55]. And before you know it you have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">55 JavaScript include 65 network request which pull down God knows how many</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">other network request. And they’re all slow and not of them, are mobile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">friendly and so at the beginning of a project knowing that’s usually a problem,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll say what’s the goal of this project? And a lot of times they say we want</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this to be really snappy on mobile, when it’s finger friendly, it’s mobile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">friendly, we want to be super fast. Okay. It’s good to know. And then six</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">months later. When they’re like yeah, I’ve throw in overture and add words and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double click in Drip and Facebook. Alright, we decided that we’re going to have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a maximum two second load time called cache on these pages. Is this worth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">throwing that constraint out? Or should we pick and choose a little bit adding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this things [00:26:47] they have no impact on the performance [00:26:49] to a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I love that you call it diagnosis. I love it because it really gets me at least into the mindset of a doctor, right? What’s the case here? Let’s figure out what’s going on. What’s necessary? And always, always asking them, what’s the business case for this? I feel you can’t go wrong asking that question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s malpractice if you don’t. I often wish that this software consulting profession</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had a sort of AMA type of body that you can be kicked out off.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sitting here scratching my chin thinking about this transition from sort of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that staff augmentation mindset which is really a great way to describe how I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thought about working with a client once I started out to this more advice</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">giving consultative mindset. It’s not easy, if you don’t feel some feeling of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">confidence in your own judgment. It’s really hard to make that transition. Have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you seen yourself go through that? You don’t count Jonathan because apparently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re confident about everything you’ve ever done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m often [00:28:03] but never in doubt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is kind of nice. What about you Reuven?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I now that I went through that transition. I definitely felt like for a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">years [00:28:22] would turn to me and say what do you think about X and I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t even feel like I was responsible for telling what I thought about X.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They weren’t necessarily asking. That was my position, I need that fellow. But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was not obvious when I start consulting to that was necessary to all part of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the job. Fortunately I don’t even want. Staff augmentation is definitely what I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">imaging consulting to be, when I started at it. That was 100% what I thought it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would be when I started at it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a good approach for people who do have that fear or maybe it’s a little</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more positive term like [00:28:59] to say what they should do. A useful tactic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is to target business that don’t have your skills in house and don’t want it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like an accountant, I don’t want be good at that. I don’t want to hire someone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do it internally. I’ll completely want to outsource that. It’s distasteful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">task in my opinion or to me. I’m probably a great customer for an accountant</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because I don’t want to get in their business at all. Now imagine if you were</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an accountant and you were going to do the books for another accountant or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone fancy themselves as an accountant. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve certainly have projects with folks who fancy themselves as developers or that’s bootstrap their way with enough technical skills to be dangerous into a successful business and then realize that they’ve over their head once they’ve got the revenues stream. Makes financial streams to I come in, they have a hard time letting go of the fact that they know how they did it and they have this pledge on when they patch together and it’s hard for them to switch that off. The better clients you can do that, the other ones eventually probably just let them go because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their constantly asking you question and they never take your advice. They just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">second guessing you and micromanaging all time or questioning decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">endlessly. Very tedious. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point I’m getting at is if you do a thing and you want to move away from staff [00:30:39] or you want to target businesses that don’t have your capability in house and want it. If you are a React developer, if you’re going to go offer your technical services to like a valley startup that has 5 other developer and staff. They’re not impressed with your skills, they’re not going to be impressed with your skills. They have 5 other guys that do what you do, or 5 other girls that do what you do. They just need another pair of hands, that’s how they’re going to treat you. But if you’re an amazing Mac developer, you could target, what I always say, dentist or you could target somebody who’s never going to have React developer on set. You can target a market who’s never going to hire a full time React developer and find problems that they have that you can solve with your skills and you will be an expert. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dumbest thing that comes out of your mouth about React is going to be 100 times better than anything that they’ll ever think of. So [00:31:39] with my</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant, my accountant would be an idiot, I have no idea. I am not smart</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">questioning her judgment. I just met her, I trust her, a friend recommended</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">her, I just trust her, and I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">know absolutely 0 about accounting and I always outsource. One way of saying</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expertise is relative. The thing that you’re an expert at is in supply those</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">current customers are probably never going to really value you that highly. You</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably want to find customers who don’t [00:32:13] more of you in house and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who probably never will. And you’ll feel much more confident because everything</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you say will be like, ugh, that’s a great idea. Go ahead and do it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It gets back to a question we got last week in the Q&amp;A. You have to be willing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to use something other than just your craft. In other words, you’re building a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business based on expertise then you have to be willing to do that business-y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuff like talk to clients. I think if you want to just do your craft 24/7 and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be around other people who are also craftsman that’s much more like being an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee than it is like being a consultant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you move out of that staff augmentation, the stakes do go up and one the ways that I started getting more comfortable with at was too just simply when I was having a meeting with a client to as  soon as possible in that pre-meeting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chitchat time to say how’s business going? Instead of how was your week end?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is fine or whatever, right? To say how’s business going? For me it was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just an easy low stakes way to start trying to get outside the scope of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project and hear from the client in their own words, how’s business going? Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the one simple thing I can advise to folks at home. If you’re in that position</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of like, oh my gosh, this sounds so risky. You’re right it is. The most risky</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing you can do is be a pair of hands where somebody else makes a decision.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Jonathan’s salary cap numbers pretty consistent with what I would say as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">                   </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It does involve risk to get away from being a pair of hands but I think there are ways to do it gradually. It’s not like an overnight transition, because that’s really setting yourself up for failure if you just expect to be able to ask the right two questions then the world open up to you and all of a sudden you’re getting triple the amount of money you used to. Doesn’t really work that way or at least it didn’t for me. Maybe I’m just slow, though.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes time. You have to learn how to do it. How to ask the right question.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which people you want to talk to. Who are the one’s worth talking to. All of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this takes a long time to get right.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a risk or reward thing. If you are happy capping out with $140 or something and you’re just comfortable, cool. That’s cool. Not saying it’s bad. But if you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to go past that, you’re going to have to take some risk. Let’s put this in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bigger scheme of things like, what are we talking about risk wise here?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not wrestling an alligator. A lead comes in and you try to handle it in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a way that you’ve never handled it before. The way that we’re describing. You</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do a diagnosis, you push back, you don’t jump to offer the lowest price. Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don’t get it for the first time. But what did you really lose? And if that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">next gig is like if you need to get it, your mortgage or your car payment or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whatever. Don’t do it on that one. Wait till you got a little bit of cushion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and when you’re feeling comfortable, then that’s time to try it a little bit different</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">way to have a wide conversation, which matter. Do a diagnosis. You’ll be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shocked what happens. You’ll be setting yourself apart from virtually everybody</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">else they’re talking to. Because no one else is going to be like, [00:36:59] is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this, yes, yes, yes. I can do everything you want. I can start tomorrow. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">other way that they’re really have to compare them, a group of people like that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is like giving the lowest hourly rate. But if you’re the one that says, oh I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can do that for you but what are you trying to achieve because it’s hard for me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to see where a company like you would benefit from this thing that you’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking me to do. And they’ll sit back, well, okay, this is what we think. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get some engaging at a completely different level, a more of a partner level.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you’ll screw up the first few times but what else do you get to do?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I’ve done three roadmapping projects from people now. And first of all,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found that laughable at the beginning that anyone would blame me to that sort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if estimate. Because really, it was certainly more thorough that the other</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated I’ve done for clients in the past. But [00:37:57] that much more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thorough. I mean, for crying out loud, it was like, 10 page instead of 5 pages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or 6 pages. And they were paying me for crying out loud. And the thing is, I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was very so nervous about asking, I have sort maybe not the best kind but a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sort of wide conversation, asking them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you like to describe a job that at least why this and why now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t really get to the why me because it was a road map and I think they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were fascinated that anyone was taking an interest in this. The way they was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">talking about their organization and wanting to hear them justify what they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were doing. I don’t think they’ve ever stepped back and thought about it. it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">think they were very pleased to have to be able to have the opportunity to do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this thinking and filter things out and this is important and that’s not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">important. And the definitely sort of putting in their eyes as an expert.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, I got an email from one of the people from where I done the road</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">map. Where they decided not to sort of go with me for the development but just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stick with their existing [00:38:54 parable ….] company and they wrote to me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and say you know we were so happy with the work that you did there. We like to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bring you and tell us how to construct a technical staff in house. You have to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">go with it. There we go. Basically, because these questions I was asking and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because of the way I was communicating with them about what are the goals? It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">totally worked to my advantage in the long term.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Look where you put yourselves in their minds they don’t see your highest value as a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer anymore it is as an adviser.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. That’s going to be the more profitable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project anyway, right?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the thing. For the audience. Let’s make it super clear what we mean buy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitable because it’s not more revenue, it’s more profit. A software project,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an implementation could be 3, 6, 9, 12 months long. That’s a lot of revenue.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your overall gross sales would be a $100,000 for a 6-month project easily.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s high revenue but it’s usually low profit because you’re either paying</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees, you’ve outsource some of the labor or you’re doing it yourself and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of your time, you have to subtract your time as a cost. It’s not that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitable. It’s stable, good income overtime but it’s not that profitable. If</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you write a 10 page report or something and they pay you four figures for it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s far more profitable. It’s only a $1000 or $2000 but you did it in three</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hours and you’re positioned in this client's line as someone’s that operates at</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a higher level, who can tell them what they should do. And so you can create a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">much more profitable in terms your price minus your cost, that’s profit. You</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can create much more profitable offerings for these people. You need to do a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lot of them because it’s not a 6 month thing, it’s like a one week thing. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">means that you can work for four hours a week. And make a good weekly income,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you get a lot of these. Overtime, you’ll start to get a lot of these and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">then you’re like wow, I’m working 20 hours a week, $300,000 a year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">People talk. I guess they talk in all industries but I feel like especially in high</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech and maybe it’s double especially in Israel where it’s like a very small</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">country. Everyone talks to each other. Maybe it’s not a coincidence actually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I was contacted by this organization and on the same day the one whom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which I was in touch, her husband runs a company called me up and said hey I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can use some software advice on things and maybe some development. Right?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically it’s amazing, it’s a total different image you write then being the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">software developer to my turn. Even though this sort of way to get to where</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they wanted involves software [00:41:44].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The funny I find with people who picture themselves as developers that anything</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s easy for them, they feel like has no value.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hahaha. That’s right.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s exactly where all the value is. It’s the thing they give away for free. They’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like somebody says to him, I’m considering using phone gap versus native iOS.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If somebody said that to me, I would ask some six questions and I tell him</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which one to do. With 100% confidence. And it would be so easy for me, air</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quotes “easy” because I’ve been studying it for 10 years. It would be so “easy”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for me to answer that one question which could swing a $1,000,000 one way or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the other for that company, they could do a $1,000,000 project using the wrong</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">choice and end up finding out at the end that it was a huge mistake. How much</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do I charge him for that? It’s a good question, depends. But it’s certainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly valuable and it adds something that you want to be giving away for free</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the time. Nothing to feel bad about charging a fair price for.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me put that in a [00:43:01] a contrast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you’ve heard that before.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I need that. This road mapping that people would call me back now easily like a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quarter of the time was me explaining to them that on a website, like web</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">application, you need to have a database server and a web server and the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">browser and how they work together. And I think most developers will be like,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what? You charge the money to explain that the web works, are you kidding me? Yes, and not only did I. But they’ve loved it and they were [00:43:35]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about it, and they’re asking for more. And that is 100% the sort of thing that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would give away in the past. I’m like well, clearly everyone should know this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if they are going to a web project the after we have been on that we can talk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">real stuff. For them this is real stuff because it’s all new. The fact that we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do it every day doesn’t make it less new to them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Just point out that value is completely contextually defined.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> And this is where I was talking about before where the Garden Variety web developer who has been doing this for three years maybe has like a CS degree has way more information about the basics of like the puzzle pieces involved with creating say an ecommerce store. Then a billion potential clients, at least millions. If you target clients who already know all that stuff that you already know, then you’re going to be perceived as not an expert. But if you target someone who knows nothing about that because they’re an accountant and they don’t care about that stuff other than what it can do for them, they don’t care about what’s under the hood. And you will be like an expert and if they click with you personality wise and you just have a good relationship and they trust you and you’re a reasonably good communicator, they’ll cling onto you like a life preserver. And you will treat them with respect and trust and you will not make them feel like an idiot when you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explain the difference between http and https and they will love you for it and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they will gladly pay you for it because it’s valuable to them. Anyway, this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">people which change to use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think about the NAV? Like if that ever comes out of Freelancers’ Show listener’s mouth?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">[00:45:18] and my shoe. Or the internet [00:45:22].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we should start wrapping up but that seems like such a natural question for someone to ask. You show enough what you’ve done, right? You’ve created this magnificent design, you’re showing it off to your client and instead of saying what do you think? What should you be asking, do you think this fairly captures the business goals or achieve a business goal we want? Is that what we should be saying?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You asked the wrong guy because I put up proposals were, like you are not allowed any input on the design of your website.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You really say that to your proposals?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:               I did one proposal where I explicitly said. Basically I said, you can give me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your input but I have to retain veto power because a lot of design decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that people tends to make, business owners tends to make are counter to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">goals of this project. You’re going to ask for bigger crisp images, you’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to ask for more images, you’re going to ask for more tracking and all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these things are going to decrease the stated goal which is to increase sales</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on mobile. It was sort of a rare project in the sense that we had our very</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear bottom line [00:46:33 metric]. They’re usually not that clear and so in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that case I was like, I’m not taking this risk unless I give myself the power</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to veto design decisions because they will affect these stated outcome. I don’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">usually go that far but this was such a clear outcome and I want going to out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">myself out for that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you do in designer view, I think the most important thing when I’m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicating with the customer, there are two things really that get</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicating, one is that we’re making good progress or not. Basically a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress update, we had some surprises with the offline support on mobile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safari we’re working on it. I think we have solution but I’ll keep you posted.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s taking longer than expected. Or we say everything is going great.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress is right on track. Here’s the timeline and here’s where we are, here’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where we end this. We’re making progress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">                     </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And then the other thing I will do in those meetings is I will say something we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">came to a fork in the road, I might not even tell them what the fork is but say</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to a fork in the road and it led me to ask this question and I will ask</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">them a business question. I’ll say something like there’s a design decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that we’re considering. This every [00:47:44] the two possibilities to them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll ask the question that is like is it more important to target 18-25 year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">old males or females or is it going to be both? I won’t even get into like the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whole, well if it’s going to be female, it should be red. If it’s going to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">males, it should be green. I'll just be like we came to a point where we didn’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have enough information about your business, usually it’s about their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers. That’s usually the question is like. What do your customers prefer?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How savvy are your users?  Should we do something really slick or really,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really [00:48:22]. Do we really down it down and make everything just spelled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">out in the interface? Give me example of a typical user. [00:48:33 Do they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand] double click, do they know how to drag and drop? And sometimes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they’ll get people like my customer don’t understand if somebody say drag and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop my customer would just stare at me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Really? Wow.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a question the other day that was like, I spent 15 minutes on the phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">call the other day I will say okay, data site is up, you guys can test it. You</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can imagine all the things say, and you’ll give me all your email address, I’ll</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create the accounts, I’m going to change your passwords, here’s something the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">interface works… I tried to make it as straightforward and non-technical as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible and I get questions like I’m doing the screen share to group the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">people and I get questions like is that the URL that it’s going to be at? And</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">questions like what browser should we use for this? It was like an internal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">admin, like almost like a WordPress administrator on Facebook. What browser</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should we use for this? Is this going to work on our PC? I’m like wow. It was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like 16 people on the phone that were like asking questions. I don’t want to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">come across like I think they’re idiots because I don’t. They’re great at their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing which has absolutely nothing with web developer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Which makes them such great clients because they appreciate your expertise. They’re not going to second guess you and the questions are coming from ignorance not stupidity and in many ways I find this sorts of clients are often easiest to work with. I guess that what you’re saying easy to work with, appreciative and often offer insights that I never would’ve thought of myself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be a superhero to them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you respect them. Problem is I think a lot of people start to disrespect them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they’re like oh these clients are so stupid or these clients are horrible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or client will ask for something that on the surface it is an idiotic request</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and if you’re the type of the person to just take orders from your clients then</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that can get really frustrating. The ramifications of the client later would be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oh, this ramifications are horrible like well you ask me to do it. But if</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead they going to ask you that’s sort of idiotic on the surface and you say</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">why do you ask that? What’s the business case for that? Why do you want that?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did you bring that up? Why did that occurred to you? And you can get at the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">root because they are totally over their heads, out of their depth. You can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">usually explain the question away. Like oh, that one matter because and say or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just install chrome, can you guys install chrome on your machines at work? You</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had it? You have it? Okay great. You’re all set, just use chrome.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I seem to remember Patrick McKenzie tells a story about when he was doing bingo card creator. This was like an applications for elementary school teachers, maybe middle school teachers. And he got some teacher asking him why does it work when I’m using the green google but not the blue google? He was like what the heck? Any technical person or most type of people would sneer at that and ignore that. But he beyond understand that if I’m not to say that was a different browsers and of course no clue about different browsers. Just in the browsers like explain things in different colors. And through that he was able to bug it and won a customer for life basically.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anybody listening to this show, you’re an expert compared to somebody. Find them. Be their champion. They will gladly pay you for it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">About that. I feel like I’m on like crazy on this show so we should probably.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is good. Any last thoughts, Philip? Anything more to say before we’re going to picks?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a perfect note to end on. Really just that the most vague level we’re</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">talking about. Really, we’re talking about how to manage a project but it kind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of boils down to where you can create the most value because if the value</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposition is compelling, you get a lot less. You just inherently in the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project get a lot less micro-management but I found this to be true for myself,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s really is how you behave. At least for me, most of the problems came from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my own behavior as a freelancer. Start there, when you’re looking to improve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">things. Go slowly. It’s a change, it’s not going to happen overnight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s nice. Jonathan, got any picks for us this week?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I do. Let me see if I can find that actual name of it. Mike Monteiro, this is especially for the designers in the room. Mike Monteiro does a fabulous canoe, [00:53:00] give it a few times that very much hammers on a lot of these same notes. But he’s very much focused on designers and I think designers are the ones that suffer from this sort of make the logo go bigger problem for the most people. They might get the idea like yeah, you’re right but what do I actually say it can be tough when it comes right down to tactical situation. Wonder [00:53:29] what I actually say and if you want more of this look for, go to the show notes, I’ll have the link to it but there’ll be a Keeno video of Mike Monteiro. I think the Keeno is called “You’ve been lied to” It’s great. If you read every word of it and as always sort of cranky old man presentation style which is great.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if I have seen that one but I definitely saw, I think it was that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one plus one or two others of this. He’s a great speaker.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. He’s one. Just sort of a random pick. Mulling to the holiday season and I have this thing that has been a trusty companion in my bag that I got from everyday carry old Gerber Shard. That’s like this little medal multi tool that does like, it’s like a bottle opener, a screwdriver. It’s kind of like the single metal that you can put in your keychain as no moving parts and I got to tell you, I use this thing all the time. Especially when I’m travelling because it’s TSA approved and in our house we’ll have a Christmas, we have a whole bunch of toys with batteries, they have this little Phillips head screw on the battery compartment and this thing is really [00:54:48] I’m going to have it in my pocket that has a Phillips head</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I’ve been using endlessly on Christmas days. By the time this comes out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe it will be too late for Christmas but whatever holiday you celebrate but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this is a great little tool to have our new keychain. And I recommend it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not made by Gerber like the baby food company. It’s a different Gerber.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerber knife, I think. I don’t know if that’s the same company. Baby food and knives, that’s kind of a weird line extension.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:           </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip, you got any picks for us this week?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan’s pick is hilarious. I earlier on the show wrote down a note to do a pick for Mike Monteiro’s book Design is a Job. I bet it’s a real similar content to that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeno talked about. Really, really good book, when I read it the first time I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">though, this is not going to be probably for me, this is for designers. But it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was recommended whatever, turned out it was a great book for anybody who</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides expertise for clients or billed things for clients. I agree with a lot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of what’s in there. It really is talking a lot how to make that transition from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pair of hands to adviser or consultant and gives a lot of practical advice for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to do that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">                         I got another book recommendation for my second pick which is a book called Start with No by a guy named Jim Camp. I read over the past month or so and that’s another book I was really expecting to just be like I don’t know. But it was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended to me enough times it got over the threshold of I’ll read it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anyway. Even though it seems like it’s not for me and it’s just amazing. It’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amazing book on how to do negotiation, a part that resonates with me and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually kind of connects back to something Jonathan said where each request</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that clients gives you, you need to have a sort of separate micro discovery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">session for that request. Which could just take 10 seconds where you say okay,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">why do we need to do that? Why do we need to make the logo bigger? Or why do we need to add those fields to hat form or whatever it is. That connects to this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">book because Jim Camp talks about how every little tiny aspect of a longer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationship a negotiating partner is the term little negotiation and again the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing that resonated with me, he talks about trying to uncover, he uses the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">word advisory to talk about who you’re negotiating with. Kind of uncover their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pain, the thing that you can help them solve and use a negotiation conversation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a way to find out what that is. It’s just completely opposite all of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">other advice I’ve ever seen on negotiation and all that other advice really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seem to me to be about power and giving what you want rather than helping</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">somebody else to get what they want at it just so happens a premium right for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that and Jim Camp’s approach just made a lot more sense to me. The book’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">called Start with No and that’s my second pick for this week.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuven:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I got one pick for this week. I’m sure all those kids are familiar with the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dilbert Cartoon. It’s got Scott Adam who draws it. I just read how to fail with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost everything and still win big kind of the story of my life which is a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">book by Scott Adams and I see it recommend, it thought okay, I’ll take a look</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at it. I would say a good quarter of it found just sort of silly and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ridiculous. But a fair amount of it is was actually quite interesting, I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in particular he says I serve more start of term that we would normally use,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">set up systems. Right, this is something that we talk about the show quite a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bit and we heard from the people whom we interview that if you set up a system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in your life and you’re more likely to do it and achieve something. And it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">talks a lot how to do that do that in different areas of your life, not just in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">work. It’s very encouraging for people who fail at things which is basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone. And he goes out of his way to mention all of the stupid things he’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">done or many of them. And how he was able to turn some of those bad things and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn them into good things. And of course he’s kind of funny too. So I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely recommend taking a look at that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess that is our show for this week. Thank you Philip and Jonathan. And thanks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to you all out there in podcast land from listening and we will talk to you all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">next week.</span>
