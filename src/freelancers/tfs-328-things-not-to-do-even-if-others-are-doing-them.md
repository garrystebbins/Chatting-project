### **Panel**

- Erik Dietrich
- Reuven Lerner

### **Summary**
The panel discusses various “things not to do” that they have seen others do. First, they advise not sticking with a single client in a pseudo employment situation. The panel also warns against biting off more than you can chew. Erik brings up not relying on global freelancing platforms like upwork.com, while Rueven cautions against saying yes to all business. The panel considers overworking and hourly rates. They also debate when to get a virtual assistant and communication tools. The panel ends with consideration on what technologies to use and warns against chasing new and shiny technologies. The episode ends with an invitation to the listeners to share their own “things not to do”.
