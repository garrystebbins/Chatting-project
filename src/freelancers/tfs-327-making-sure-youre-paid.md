### **Episode Summary:**
In this episode of the Freelancers' Show, the panel talks to Steve Pomerantz, Founder and CEO at [Freelance Collection.](https://www.freelancecollection.com/)Steve has worked on projects as a freelancer where he has not been paid and he noticed that there aren't that many resources to help guide freelancers that are in this position. He founded [Freelance Collection](https://www.freelancecollection.com/) to help others who are unable to collect payment from their clients. Steve gives guidelines on how to handle such situations and when to hire a professional vs. when to walk away. Steve also reminds that a lot of freelancers have had projects where they have not been paid and the golden rule is to be proactive and take the necessary actions within the first month following the project, as the longer the process drags out the less the probability to collect the total money owed. The panel shares some of their personal experiences where they have had difficulty with clients. Steve then lists some of the red flags that freelancers should watch out for in clients before they start projects.
