On episode 236 of The Freelancers Show, Jonathan Stark, Philip Morgan, and Reuven Lerner discuss about how you can have&nbsp; **Your First Digital Product**. Tune in, and learn what it is and how it allows you to earn while you sleep.

## What is a Digital Product?

Digital products are those that don't need shipping. They have no physical form, and are can be purchased online. Examples are ebooks, videos, and audio files. It gives freelancers the opportunity to earn apart from their usual projects with clients. In some way, they could be looking for something else and need to make money.

## No Touch Sales and Delivery

One thing you'll enjoy about digital products is that it doesn't need a ton of work to be sold and delivered. Sellers can place their products for sale and earn. Other services may require some amount of work, but these products doesn't necessarily require sellers to do anything. Freelancers can do this to leverage their expertise. They can even sell their products many times over. It's definitely a good way to earn passive income.

## Physical Book vs Ebook
