### **Episode Summary:**
In this episode of the Freelancers' Show, the panel talks about being nervous about pricing the services offered when freelancing. They mention that most of the time, freelancers tend to price their services on the low side due to lack of self confidence. The panel also shares possible scenarios of client feedback and the best responses that justify the price. They discuss setting hourly rates versus results oriented pricing and share tips on how to communicate with the client during the proposal stage to figure out how much the service offered is worth to them. They then advise using this information to help set the price. Listen to the show to find out how to price freelance services with a business mindset.
