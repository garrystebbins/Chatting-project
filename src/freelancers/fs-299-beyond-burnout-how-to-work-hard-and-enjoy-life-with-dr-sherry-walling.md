**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- How to Prioritize Your Life
  - Great start – you found something that you love to do as far as work!
  - Have a variety of things going on in your life.
  - Have backup strategies in play.
  - “Make it big plan” is a low frequency event.
- Are there areas where freelancers chronically under invest in? 
  - Sleep
  - Diet
  - Exercise 
    - It’s easy to neglect your body.
  - Time with friends
    - Connecting you with human beings.
    - Connections with online friends are great, but real-life friendships are better for mental health because we connect better with three-dimensional people.
- If you make the investments into yourself (sleeping, eating well, exercising) this will better your business.
  - This notion of should or shouldn’t do X, Y, Z.
  - Paul Jarris’ newsletter: Defining What Enough Is For You?
  - Budgeting together as a family.
    - Gives you a clear sense of what “enough” is for you and your family. 
  - Examples:
    - [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)
      - Works 24/7 and is CEO of many companies.
      - Admired by many, but lifestyle seems toxic to some.
      - Wisdom is knowing your own personal limits. 
    - Silicon Valley, CA
    - [Patrick Collison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Collison)
      - Humble person
      - Dr. Walling was very impressed on how aware he is as a person.
      - He recognizes that the right events were in-place and he put in the work, too. 

- 
  - **Burnout** – different stages and things we can do to address burnout
    - Burnout is a syndrome where people feel detached from their work. They feel like their input does not equal their output. 
    - It’s subjective.
    - It’s caused by too much work, feeling out-of-control in your work, a mismatch of daily tasks versus what needs to be done, not enough support, and working with clients who are emotionally draining, etc.
    - Scientifically we can view a brain that is burned-out.
    - Other health problems can arise due to stress.
    - We know how to prevent it and how people can recover.
    - It could take a few weeks in order to regain a healthy lifestyle to recover from burnout. 
    - Road to recovery
    - 30% of adults experience burnout in some point in their life. 
    - [Dr. Christina Maslach](https://maslach.socialpsychology.org)
      - Her research is focused on burnout.
    - Time is finite and life is finite.
      - You will choose things that are more gratifying for you and your life.
    - Sometimes we forget the “love” piece.
      - I choose to do the activities that really bring me joy.
      - This will help with the longevity of your business.
      - Not things that you feel like you “should.”
      - Listen to the emotional quality to your work to help prevent potential burnout.
    - Hobbies
      - If you have some hobbies like yoga, fishing, painting, baking, knitting etc. it can definitely help prevent burnout.
      - Hobbies are good for a sense of accomplishment.
        - Mastery and it feeds your soul.

- 
  - **Protecting Personal Relationships**
    - Rhythms and structures in our relationships.
      - Regularity of date night once a week (for example) helps establishing this routine.
      - The same is true for friendships.
    - Find a good mentor.
      - Grow together and it’s great for psychological support.
    - Fitness goals
      - If you don’t use it, you will loose it. 
      - This gets more important the older you get.
