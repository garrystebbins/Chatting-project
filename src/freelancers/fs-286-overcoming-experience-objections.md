  In this episode of the Freelancers’ Show, the panelists discuss overcoming objections that your clients might have regarding your experience. They have found that if you have good rapport with your clients, they are more likely to ask you to work on other concepts, even if it’s a little different than what you normally focus on. It’s important not to lean away from your normal too much so that you don’t overextend yourself and fail on what you promise to your clients. This episode is great for freelancer’s who want to hear about the thought process behind pushing the envelope when it comes to your experience with your clients. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:&nbsp;**
