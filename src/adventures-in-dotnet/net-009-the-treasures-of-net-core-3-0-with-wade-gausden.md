In this week’s episode of Adventures in .NET the panel interviews Wade Gausden, who is well known for his website dotnetcoretutorials.com. When Wade got started in .NET around .NET 2.0 the documentation was terrible, so he started this website where he would write posts about the problems he ran into and how he solved them. The panel discusses how as .NET and C# have grown and evolved, making things easier. 

Wade shares his experience using .NET Core on a greenfield project he was consulting on. Caleb shared his experience porting over to .NET Core from .NET Framework. While .NET Core was a breath of fresh air, they had to use a lot of workarounds to get the result they wanted. Wade commiserates telling the panel that one of his most popular posts still is about how to send an email in .NET Core. 

Caleb expresses his appreciation for all the work they did to make porting over easier in .NET 2.. He answers Wade’s questions about how they ported over. Caleb tells him how he spent months figuring out how to rearchitect and that their main pain point was code first migrations. Caleb shares a little about his current project, where they are using .NET Core 2.0 and Angular 6. His next project will be using .NET Core 3.0 and Angular 8.

This leads the panel to discuss the treasures that can be found in the release of .NET 3.0. They discuss null reference management and Blazor. The panel compares webforms and Blazor, with all they get with Blazor, webforms are dead. The panel is sure that nullable reference types will get a lot of use along with iAsyncEnumerble. 

Other new releases in .NET 3.0 they are not so sure will get as much use, such as the range type. They discuss the potential of default interface methods once people wrap their minds around the idea. Wade explains what IL Linker Support is and what it does, it is basically tree shaking for .NET. 

The panel wonders at what it means for Winforms and WPF apps now that .NET Core supports desktop apps. They think that it won’t actually get that much use. Caleb speculates that it was a business move to help prepare for .NET 5 as a way to preserve it’s cross platforming capabilities.  

The panel asks Wade about his favorite posts on his site. Wade explains that he loves the multipart series, his most recent being on the use of dapper. Dapper runs SQL statements and helps protect you from SQL injections and other things of that nature. He wrote it to help a friend of his understand the importance of knowing a little SQL. The panel chimes in, explaining that when it comes to working in .NET and C# SQL is essential.
