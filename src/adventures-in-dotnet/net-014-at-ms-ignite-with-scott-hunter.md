Getting a little sidetracked, Scott clears up any confusion about Blazor Server-side and Blazor Client-side. He explains that he has read and heard about people waiting to use Blazor Client-side because Blazor Server-side is not ready for use. Blazor Server-side is a wonderful and powerful tool, Scott tells listeners. He shares the use cases where you would want to use server-side and client-side.

After getting back on track, Scott and Shawn discuss WPF in WinForms. Scott explains the benefits of moving WPF apps to .NET Core. They discuss ML.net and Microsoft&#39;s goals with AI.
