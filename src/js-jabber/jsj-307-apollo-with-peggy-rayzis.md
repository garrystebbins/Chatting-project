**Special Guests:** Peggy Rayzis

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists talk about Apollo with Peggy Rayzis. Peggy is an open source engineer on the [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) team where she primarily focuses on client stuff, working on [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/client/), and also other libraries. Previously, she was a UI engineer at [Major League Soccer](https://www.mlssoccer.com/) where she worked primarily with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). She discusses what [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is and how it is used, as well as how they use it in the Apollo team to make their lives as developers easier. They also touch on when it would work best to use GraphQL and when it is not ideal to use it.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
