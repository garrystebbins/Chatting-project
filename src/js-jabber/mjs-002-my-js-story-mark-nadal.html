<h2>My JS Story Mark Nadal</h2>
On today's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood welcomes Mark Nadal. Mark  runs  GUN, an open source fire-based. He loves open source community that's why he focuses on it. On this, he shares how he got into the world of programming, and we'll find out how he feels about doing it.
<h2>How Mark Got into Programming?</h2>
Mark's journey in programming started when he worked on a mathematics theorem. It took him 3 years developing a model for it.

He got frustrated when found out that it takes him 20 minutes to solve basic math problems. Because of that, he encouraged himself that he can do better. He believed that if he can simultaneously spin up like a ton of computers, he can solve thousands of problems near the instantaneously.

He initially thought programming is easy to get into just as how he's doing enough work with logic, mathematics, and philosophy in general. However, he ended up in regret after realizing how programming specifically works.
<h2>Programming Addiction</h2>
Mark became scared of programming after his realizations, but the funny thing is that it became increasingly addictive for him. Academics appeared to be boring for him, and he didn't like the idea that it will take him years before he could create his own original ideas. He'd rather delve into practically working on programming than spend time on theories that's why he got sucked up into it.
<h2>What Makes Programming Interesting?</h2>
Programming is about solving things that haven't been solved before. Mark emphasizes how it is opposite to most jobs today. Instructions are given and workers just have to follow day-in and day-out. In programming, one writes the instructions.

Oftentimes, somebody writes a library or a framework for us to use. However, our way of making money still boils down to solving problems. Mark further discusses on this connecting it to his attendance in Utah JS.
