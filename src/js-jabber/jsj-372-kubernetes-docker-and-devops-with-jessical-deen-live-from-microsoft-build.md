## Episode Summary

Coming to you live from the podcast booth at Microsoft BUILD is Charles Max Wood with The Deen of DevOps aka[ Jessica Deen](https://jessicadeen.com). Jessica is a Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. As an advocate she acts a liaison between developer communities and Microsoft to help understand developer pain points and road blocks especially in areas such as Linux, open-source technologies, infrastructure, Kubernetes, containers and DevOps. Jessica explains how to go about setting up a containerized application, Kubernetes and how to use Dockerfiles. Charles and Jessica then talk about how to get started with a Kubernetes cluster and the resources available for developers that don't have any infrastructure. Jessica advises that developers start with Azure DevOps Services and then go to Microsoft Learn Resource.

Charles also encourages listeners to also check out the Views on Vue podcast[ Azure DevOps with Donovan Brow](https://devchat.tv/views-on-vue/vov-053-azure-devops-with-donovan-brown-live-at-microsoft-ignite/)n for further references. Jessica also recommends following people on Twitter and GitHub to find out about solutions and resources.
