### **Episode Summary**
James Shore is a developer who specializing in extreme programming, an Agile method. He also used to host a screencast called [Let’s Code Test-Driven JavaScript](https://www.letscodejavascript.com/). They begin by discussing the core of Agile development, which James believes is being responsive to customers and business partners in a way that’s sustainable and humane for the programmers involved. It prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools. More can be found in [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).James delves into the historical context of the immersion of Agile and how things have changed from the 90’s. Now, the name Agile is everywhere, but the ideals of agile are not as common. There is a tendency to either take Agile buzzwords and apply them to the way it was done long ago, or it’s absolute chaos. James talks about ways to implement Agile in the workplace. He believes that the best way to learn Agile is work with someone who knows Agile, or read a book on it and then apply it. James recommends his book [The Art of Agile Development: Pragmatic Guide to Agile Software Development](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-Pragmatic-Software/dp/0596527675/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1548462018&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=devchattv-20&linkId=f06bfe7482dca8bb751ed6d7cc86e2ab&language=en_US) for people who want to started with Agile development. The panelists talk about where people often get stuck with implementing Agile. The hosts talk about their own processes in their company. They discuss how people involved in the early days of Agile are disappointed in how commercial it has become.They agree that what’s really the most important is the results. If you can respond to a request to change direction in less than two weeks and you don’t have to spend months and months preparing something, and you do that in a way where the people on the team feel like their contributing, then you’re doing Agile. James thinks that the true genius of Agile is in the way the actual work is done rather than in the way your organize the work. **Links**
