 **Panel:**

**Special Guests:** AJ O'Neal

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panel talks to AJ O'Neal about Greenlock and LetsEncrypt. [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a brand name and is the first of its kind in automated SSL and [Greenlock](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/greenlock.js.git) does what [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) does in a more simplified form. They talk about what led him to create Greenlock, compare Greenlock to Certbot, and what it’s like to use Greenlock. They also touch on [Greenlock-express](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/greenlock-express.js), how they make Greenlock better, and more!
