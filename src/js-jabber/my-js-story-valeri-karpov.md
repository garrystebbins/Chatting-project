## My JS Story&nbsp;Valeri Karpov
Welcome to the 11th My JS Story! Today, Charles Max Wood welcomes Valeri Karpov. Valeri is a Platform Tech Lead at Booster Fuels, the author of Professional Angular JS and The 80/20 Guide to ES2015 Generators, and a blogger at codebarbarian.com. He is also the one who maintains mongoose JS.&nbsp;Stay tuned to&nbsp; **My JS Story Valeri Karpov&nbsp;** to learn more how he started coding and what he is currently up to!
## Start of His Coding Journey
Just like how any kid of his age did, he got so fascinated with Pokémon. When he learned using the internet, he found out that it had a lot of Pokémon stuff in there. He then started to learn everything about the game such as stats, levels, and strategies. That interest led him to know&nbsp;about HTML, CSS, PHP, and a lot more. Valeri was around 9 or 10 when he got started with PHP and HTML. His parents bought him a book on HTML which he read from cover to cover. When he reached high school, &nbsp;he remembers participating in algorithms contest. In college, he then majored CS &nbsp;and realized he was going to be a nerd for life.
## Jumping into JavaScript
He got into JavaScript when he did his very first startup called Scavenger in 2008, but now known as LevelUp. It's a mobile paper platform that was originally&nbsp;text message based. &nbsp;Before iPhone came into existence, they served as a mobile gaming company&nbsp;in the foot phone era. Since they needed to build out these Scavenger Hunts, they created a little web-based dashboard for it. This was his first non-trivial JavaScript experience. They used JavaScript because the other alternative Valeri only knew of was Java X and Swing, which were a lot worse.
