<h2>My JS Story Max Lynch</h2>
On today's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood welcomes Max Lynch. Max is part of the Ionic Framework and has appeared on episode 126 in the JavaScript Jabber show. Tune in to <strong>My JS Story Max Lynch</strong> as he shares his journey to becoming part of the world of programming.
<h2>Max's Meaningful Start</h2>
At the early age of 12 or 13, Max had a family friend who was a software developer and knew that Max liked to break into his parent's computer a lot. This developer lent him Java 1.1 book. However, Max didn't understand a single thing after reading it.

When he got older, he had this modem handbook with EarthLink. At the back of his 14.4k modem was an HTML, and there were tutorials in the handbook as well. He then began building simple websites, and he discovered about knowing what to do with JavaScript. He had more exposures to it since then.
<h2>Ending Up with JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript was the first actual programming language he learned. He ended up doing it because he was doing HTML. He got to the point where he wanted to go beyond that like if he clicks one button he gets to annoy someone with an alert prompt.

He was kind of forced to really understand things. Eventually, he got a book on JavaScript around when JavaScript leveled up.
<h2>Landmarks from Click Handlers to Framework</h2>
After the humble beginnings he had in JavaScript, he eventually got into PHP. The reason why he went onto it was because he wanted to build websites and do more stuff like communicate with friends, have a forum, and blog posts. It was like the Facebook years back. In the process of working with PHP, he got back into JavaScript.

In college, he had an internship at an insurance company which asked him to build a server management portal. This was the same time when jQuery came out. That's when his JavaScript skills leveled up.
