**Special Guests:** Christine Legge

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panel talks to Christine Legge about functional programming with Ramda. Christine is a front-end software engineer and just recently got a new job in New York working at Google. [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) is a utility library in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) that focuses on making it easier to write JavaScript code in a functional way. They talk about functional programming and what it is, using Ramda in [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and referential transparency. They also touch on why she first got into Ramda, compare Ramda to Lodash and Underscore, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
