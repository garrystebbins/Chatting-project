## My JS Story Joe Fiorini
Welcome to the 9th My JS Story! Today, Charles Max Wood welcomes Joe Fiorini. Joe has been into programming since his teenage years. He discussed about functional reactive programming in [episode 61 of JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/061-jsj-functional-reactive-programming-with-juha-paananen-and-joe-fiorini). Get to know him better at **My JS Story Joe Fiorini**.
## Off an&nbsp;Early Start
Joe has always been interested in computers. Growing up, he learned to copy-paste&nbsp;codes from basic help examples. It was not until high school that he learned to build a software. He had a teacher who taught them about programming. Their class built a search engine, which the school eventually used for students and classroom schedules.
## Learning Ruby
As he continued learning, Joe became frustrated with the whole Microsoft development environment. He wanted something that he could work on from scratch. That's when Ruby on Rails started becoming popular. He spent nights and weekends to do whatever he could to learn. In the process, he saw the problem with JavaScript.
## Problem with JavaScript
Joe started a user group in Cleveland when he started on Ruby. He remembers speaking about Rails in their first meeting. The night before the event, he updated his gems. But all of a sudden he also had Rails. Github wasn't available or popular that time. So, he went through and updated everything. He noticed how a lot of developers feared JavaScript. He felt the same way, but his interest in codes surpassed his fears. To hear the rest of _My JS Story Joe Fiorini_, download and listen&nbsp;to the entire episode.
