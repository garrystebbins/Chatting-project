<h2>My JS Story Richard Feldman</h2>
Welcome to the 9th My JS Story! Today, Charles Max Wood welcomes Richard Feldman. Richard works at No Red Ink, and he is the author of Elm in Action. He was in JavaScript Jabber and talked about Elm with Evan Czlapicki in <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/175-jsj-elm-with-evan-czaplicki-and-richard-feldman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode 175</a> and covered the same topic alone in <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/229-jsj-elm-with-richard-feldman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode 229</a> . Stay tuned to <strong>My JS Story Richard Feldman </strong>to learn more how he started in programming and what he's up to now.
<h2>Embarking into Programming</h2>
When he was around 8 or 9 years old, Richard always wanted to create games. He kept bothering his dad to enroll him in classes that would teach him to create computer games, but he would always get declined. Later his dad bought him a book titled Learn Basic Now which he didn't initially read.

Soon he got grounded from using the computer, but he managed to convince his dad not to because of the book. Since then he started to read the book his dad bought him and learned how to program. He fell in love with programming and felt doing it to be really rewarding throughout the years.
<h2>His Journey to Elm</h2>
The road to Elm covers 20 years of his life. When he started with Elm, he thought that he'd become a professional game programmer. The idea of becoming a web developer didn't cross his mind since that wasn't a career back then.

Starting with Basic, he went through Java and C ++ among others. He got into JavaScript when he took it as an extension course at UCLA. He didn't pay too much attention to lectures since he already knew the languages taught. At the end of the course, he was the only one who aced the exam.
