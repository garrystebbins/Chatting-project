## **Loading and Optimizing Web Applications with Sam Saccone and Jeff Cross**

On today's episode, Charles Max Wood, Joe Eames, and Aimee Knight&nbsp;discuss **Loading and Optimizing Web Applications with Sam Saccone and Jeff Cross**. Tune in to their interesting talk, and learn how you can improve user experience and performance with better loading!

## **Challenges with Mobile Devices**

When Charles was just starting in web development, he simply load in files—the usual process. However, things change over time. Developers keep adding more and more things to enhance their websites. The rise of&nbsp;mobile devices has increased the competition as well. Among the challenges are mobile networks and batteries. Overall, developers find ways to improve their sites with regards to performance and user experience.

## **Ways to Enhance Loading&nbsp;**

Progress comes at a cost. The trick, according to Sam, is to ship and send less code. People tend to ship&nbsp;a lot of things that are just either deferred or not shipped at all. Jeff believes the other way around. He has been working on angular, and has tried to solve problems using the usual framework. There are effective techniques to do so.

## **A Better Experience for All&nbsp;**

Minification and tree shaking are among the processes&nbsp;that developers use&nbsp;to load their sites faster. They take all the unnecessary codes that prevent better performance. Either process,&nbsp;developers try to come up with&nbsp;a static file in their sites. The file does not have to run the compiler and browser, thus, providing better performance and better user experience. Here are the links for this episode:
