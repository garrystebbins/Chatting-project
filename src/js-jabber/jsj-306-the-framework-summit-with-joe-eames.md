**Panel:**

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists talk about the [Framework Summit](https://www.frameworksummit.com/). It was the brainchild of Merrick Christensen. This summit includes talks on multiple different frameworks all in a two-day conference, which allows you to get exposed to new frameworks while still learning more about the framework your job requires you to use. Another goal of the conference is that it will be able to open people’s eyes up to the different frameworks available to them and show that no one framework is superior to another.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- What is the [Framework Summit](https://www.frameworksummit.com/)?
- The framework you use plays a huge role in your programming
- For people who want to learn about more than one framework
- Allows you to explore
- The format of the conference
- Park City, Utah in October 2018
- Helps you answer which framework should you use?
- Goal is to open people’s eyes up to other frameworks
- Decrease internet arguments over which framework is better

- [_Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion_ by Jonathan Haidt](https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777)
- Some people will never look beyond their frameworks
- If it’s working, why would you mess with it?
- And much, much more!
