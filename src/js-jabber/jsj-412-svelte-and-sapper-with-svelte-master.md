question1: What is Svelte?
answer1: >-
  Svelte is a JavaScript framework similar to React and Vue. When you write
  components, Svelte will compile it into Vanilla JS, CSS, or HTML, and create a
  small bundle that will be sent to the client. Svelte is a ‘disappearing
  framework’, so your bundles come out as DOM APIs and there is no Svelte in the
  end result.
question2: What is an advantage of using Svelte?
answer2: >-
  Because the framework is not sent with the bundle, bundle sizes are
  significantly smaller and it can run on all browsers.
question3: What is Sapper?
answer3: >-
  Sapper is a companion technology to Svelte that gives you server side
  rendering, routing, code splitting, and other features. 
question4: What is Svelte Master's favorite thing about Svelte?
answer4: >-
  Svelte lets you write less code, cuts down on unnecessary code, and makes
  state management simple.

Noah, a.k.a. Svelte Master, is from Indiana and recently moved to San Francisco. He has been given title Computational Linguist by SoundHound. He starts the show by talking about his Youtube channel all about Svelte. Svelte is a JavaScript framework similar to React and Vue. When you write components, Svelte will compile it into Vanilla JS, CSS, or HTML, and create a small bundle that will be sent to the client. Svelte is a ‘disappearing framework’, so your bundles come out as DOM APIs and there is no Svelte in the end result. Because the Svelte framework doesn’t send with the bundle, bundle sizes are significantly smaller, and it runs on all browsers. Noah shares some Svelte’s performance statistics. Sapper is a companion technology to Svelte that gives you server side rendering, routing, code splitting, and other features. 

Noah talks about how to write plugins for Svelte and embedding components. One main difference between Svelte and other frameworks is that it lacks a virtual DOM. This is because since it is just compiling down to JavaScript and the framework is not sent with the package, it doesn’t need a virtual DOM and instead updates as things change. Noah talks more about how this works. Some of Svelte Master’s favorite things about Svelte is that you write less code, especially unnecessary code, and state management is simple. He talks about how routing is handled through other tools like Sapper. The panel talks about methods for testing a Svelte app, adding Svelte components into a website, and pulling in third party libraries. They discuss whether there are things that you can’t do with Svelte that would require React or Vue. The show ends with Noah talking about what the future holds for Svelte and how to get started with it.
