In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists talk about [React: The Big Picture](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-big-picture), Cory’s course on Pluralsight and what [React](https://reactjs.org/) is all about. They discuss both the pros and cons when it comes to using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and when it would be the best to use this library. They also encourage programmers to use React in a more consistent way so that people can share components.
