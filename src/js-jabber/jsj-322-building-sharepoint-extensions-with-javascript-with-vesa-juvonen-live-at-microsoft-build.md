**Special Guests:** Vesa Juvonen

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panel talks to Vesa Juvonen about building SharePoint extensions with JavaScript. Vesa is on the [SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-US/sharepoint/collaboration?ms.officeurl=sharepoint) development team and is responsible for the [SharePoint Framework](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki), which is the modern way of implementing SharePoint customizations with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). They talk about what SharePoint is, why they chose to use JavaScript with it, and how he maintains isolation. They also touch on the best way to get started with SharePoint, give some great resources to help you use it, and more!
