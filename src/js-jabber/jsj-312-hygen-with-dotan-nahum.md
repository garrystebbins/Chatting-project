**Special Guests:** Dotan Nahum

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists discuss Hygen with Dotan Nahum. Dotan has worked within open source community, where he created [Hygen](http://www.hygen.io/). They talk about what Hygen is, how it came to be, and code generators in general. He was inspired by the [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) generator to create his own generator and took his inspiration from 12 years prior to creating Hygen.
