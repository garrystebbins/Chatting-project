<p class="p1"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks with programmer, <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris Heilmann</span></a>. He has written books about <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a>, in addition to writing a blog about it and is an educator about this program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He currently resides in Berlin, Germany. Let’s welcome our special guest and listen to today’s episode!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:19 – Chuck talks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:41 – Chris: He has talked about <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a> in Berlin upon an invitation. You can get five different suggestions about how to use <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a>. The best practices, I have found, are on the projects I am on now. <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a> was built in ten days. My goal is to help people navigate through <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s4">JavaScript</span></a> and help them feel not disenfranchised. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:47 – Aimee: The overall theme is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:54 – Panelist: I really like what you said about helping people not feeling disenfranchised. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:47 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a>: There is a lot of peer pressure at peer conferences</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:30 – Aimee chimes in with some comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:50: Chris: I think we need to hunt the person down that put...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:03 – Panelist: A good point to that is, I try to avoid comments like, “Well, like we ALL know...”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:27 – Chris: There are things NOT to say on stage. It happens, but we don’t want to say certain things while we are teaching people. We are building products with different groups, so keep that in mind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:40 – Aimee: My experience in doing this is that I have found it very rewarding to share embarrassing experiences that I’ve had. My advice would to tell people to let their guard down. It’s encouraging for me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:26 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a>: It helps to show that you are vulnerable and show that you are still learning, too. We are all learning together. 90% of our job is communicating with others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:05 – <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw?lang=en"><span class="s4">Chuck</span></a>: Now, I do want to ask this...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:35 – Chris answers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:24 – What makes you say that? (Question to Chris)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:25 – Chris answers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:55 – Chuck: The different systems out there are either widely distributed or...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">You will have to work with other people. There is no way that people can make that on their own. If you can’t work with other people, then you are a hindrance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:31 – Aimee chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:53 – Chris: They have to be very self-assured. I want to do things that are at the next level. Each developer has his or her own story. I want to move up the chain, so I want to make sure these developers are self-assured. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:07 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a>: Back to the article...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:26 – Chuck: Yes, I agree. Why go and fight creating a whole system when it exists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:54 – Chris chimes in with some comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:38 – Panelist: I still use console logs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:48 – Chris: We all do, but we have to...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:55 – Aimee: In the past year, I can’t tell you how much I rely on this. Do I use <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s4">Angular</span></a>? Do I learn Vue? All those things that you can focus on – tools.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:21 – Chris: We are talking about the ethics of interfaces. Good code is about accessibility, privacy and maintainability, among others. Everything else is sugar on top. We are building products for other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:10 – Chuck: That is the interesting message in your post, and that you are saying: having a deep, solid knowledge of <a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s4">React</span></a> (that is sort of a status thing...). It is other things that really do matter. It’s the impact we are having. It’s those things that will make the difference. Those things people will want to work with and solves their problems. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:00 – Chris adds his comments. He talks about Flash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:05 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a>: The librarian motto: “I don’t know everything, but I can look “here” to find the answer.” We don’t know everything. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:31 – Aimee: Learn how to learn. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:50 – Chris: There is a big gap in the market. Scratch is a cool tool and it’s these puzzle pieces you put together. It was hard for me to use that system. No, I don’t want to do that. But if you teach the kids these tools then that’s good. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:56 – <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw?lang=en"><span class="s4">Chuck</span></a>: Here is the link, and all I had to do was write<a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s4"> React</span></a> components.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:12 – Chris: My first laptop was 5x more heavy then this one is. Having access to the Internet is a blessing. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">27:24 – <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"><span class="s2">Advertisement</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:21 – Chuck: Let’s bring this back around. If someone has gone through boot camp, you are recommending that they get use to know their editor, debugging, etc. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chris: 28:47 – Chris: Yes, get involved within your community. <a href="https://github.com"><span class="s4">GitHub</span></a>. This is a community effort. You can help. Writing code from scratch is not that necessary anymore. Why rebuild something if it works. Why fix it if it’s not broken?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:00 – Chuck talks about his experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:13 – Chris continues his thoughts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chris: Start growing a community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:01 – Chuck: What ways can people get involved within their community? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:13 – Chris: <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s4">Meetup.</span></a> There are a lot of opportunities out there. Just going online and seeing where the conferences </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:08 – Chris: It’s interesting when I coach people on public speaking. Sharing your knowledge and learning experience is great!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:50 – Chuck: If they are learning how to code then...by interacting with people you can get closer to what you need/want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:30 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a> continues this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:49 – Chris: You can be the person that helps with x, y, z. Just by getting your name known then you can get a job offer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:23 – <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw?lang=en"><span class="s4">Chuck</span></a>: How do you find out what is really good content – what’s worth your time vs. what’s not worth your time?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:36 –Chris says, “That’s tricky!” Chris answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:19: Chris: The best things out there right now is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:45 – Chuck: Anything else that people want to bring up?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:00 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a> continues to talk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:26 – <a href="http://www.aimeemarieknight.com"><span class="s4">Aimee</span></a> adds in her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Aimee: I would encourage people to...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:00 – Chris continues the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chris: Each project is different, when I build a web app is different then when I build a...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:07 – Panelist: I agree. You talked about abstractions that don’t go away. You use abstractions in what you use. At some point, it’s safe to rly on this abstraction, but not this one. People may ask themselves: maybe <a href="https://coffeescript.org"><span class="s4">CoffeeScript</span></a> wasn’t the best thing for me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">46:11 – Chris comments and refers to<a href="https://jquery.com"><span class="s4"> jQuery</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:58 – Chris continues the conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chris: I used to work on eight different projects and they worked on different interfaces. I learned about these different environments. This is the project we are now using, and this will like it for the end of time. This is where abstractions are the weird thing. What was the use of the abstraction if it doesn’t have longevity? I think we are building things too soon and too fast. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:04 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a>: When I work in browsers and come up with brand new stuff. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">52:21 – Panelist: Your points are great, but there are some additional things we need to talk about. Let’s take <a href="https://jquery.com"><span class="s4">jQuery</span></a> as an example. There is a strong argument that if you misuse the browser...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:45 – Chris: The main issue I have with <a href="https://jquery.com"><span class="s4">jQuery</span></a> is that people get an immediate satisfaction. What do we do besides this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">55:58 – Panelist asks Chris further questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:25 – Chris answers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chris: There are highly frequent websites that aren’t being maintained and they aren’t maintainable anymore. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:09 – Panelist: Prototypes were invented because...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:51 – Chris: It’s a 20/20 thing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:04 – Panelist: Same thing can be said about the Y2K.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:20 – Panelist: Yes, they had to solve that problem that day. The reality is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:44 – <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s4">Chris</span></a>: We learned from that whole experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:00:51 – Chris: There was a lot of fluff around it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:35 – Panelist: Being able to see the future would be a very helpful thing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:43 – Chris continues the conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:02:44 – Chuck: How do people get ahold of you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03:04 – Twitter is probably the best way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03:32 – Let’s go to picks!</span></p>
