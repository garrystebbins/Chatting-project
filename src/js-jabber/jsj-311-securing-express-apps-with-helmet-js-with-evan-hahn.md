 **Panel:**

Charles Max Wood

**Special Guests:** Evan Hahn

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists discuss securing Express apps with Helmet.js with Evan Hahn. Evan is a developer at [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), which is a company that builds spreadsheet applications that are powerful enough that you can make applications with. He has also worked at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), which does payment processing for companies. They talk about what [Helmet.js](https://helmetjs.github.io/) is, when you would want to use it, and why it can help secure your [Express](https://expressjs.com/) apps. They also touch on when you wouldn’t want to use Helmet and the biggest thing that it saves you from in your code.
