## My JS Story Alex Russel
On this week's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood interviews **Alex Russel**. Alex is a software engineer on the Chrome team. He focuses on designing new features and running their standards work. He appeared as a guest on [episode 87](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/087-jsj-tc39-with-alex-russell), where he talked about TC39. Tune in to his story!
## Early Beginnings
Alex had access to a computer as a child. His father was a mechanical engineer who always had a computer. But, it was only when he reached high school that he got interested with it. He had access to Unix computers which had on a C Shell compiler. He also even had access to Pascal. In the process, he learned HTML from a particular website as well as&nbsp;JavaScript. That gave him a step ahead of his peers.
## Not Too Bad
Alex did not do well at school. He dropped out of college, and did a couple of security stuffs at the side. His experiences exposed him to JavaScript. Back then, CSS was still new. He saw the start of a couple of things in programming. Looking back,&nbsp;he remembers the page would reload from scratch every time they resize the browser window.
## Past and Present Days
The community found each other in the web, and started comparing their works. It was a community of those who made the first generation of libraries. Now, Alex&nbsp;commends the quality of dev tools and the consistency between implementations. In the past, they had to spend a lot of time just to navigate through things. There were no console tools to begin with. To hear the rest of _My JS Story Alex Russel_, download and listen&nbsp;to the entire episode.
