**Show Topics:**

1:45 – There are two main things that Nader works with. Check out this timestamp to see what they are.

3:29 – AJ to Nader: Tell me more about manage cloud. I am not sure about [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_USsc_publisher=google&sc_medium=ACQ-P%257CPS-GO%257CNon-Brand%257CDesktop%257CSU%257CSecurity%257CCognito%257CUS%257CEN%257CText&sc_content=cognito_p&sc_detail=cognito&sc_category=Security&sc_segment=293649588890&sc_matchtype=p&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!293649588890!p!!g!!cognito&ef_id=W5RTKgAAAUa7GPf1:20180908225434:s).

3:56 – [Yes, Cognito is used by/through Amazon.](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_USsc_publisher=google&sc_medium=ACQ-P%257CPS-GO%257CNon-Brand%257CDesktop%257CSU%257CSecurity%257CCognito%257CUS%257CEN%257CText&sc_content=cognito_p&sc_detail=cognito&sc_category=Security&sc_segment=293649588890&sc_matchtype=p&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!293649588890!p!!g!!cognito&ef_id=W5RTKgAAAUa7GPf1:20180908225434:s)

5:06 – What are the other manage cloud services that companies want to offer through the tools you have?

5:12 – Nader answers AJ’s question.

7:30 – Can you give me more specifics on the storage solutions you are offering?

8:03 – Nader answers AJ’s question. People store websites there for example. Frontend developers are using S3 buckets, and they are using the library, which is a storage solution.

9:10 – AJ and Nader are having a dialogue between different situations, and Nader is giving the solutions to those hypothetical situations.

10:17 – AJ: “I am interested in what you are talking about [AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/). Can you tell me how that works?” AJ is picking Nader’s brain about how [AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) works.

11:05 – Nader: “It is a single API layer for a point of entry. You can have multi-data sources.” Nader continues, in detail, answering AJ’s question.

12:36 – AJ: As a frontend developer, it sounds like I will have to become familiar with the backend, too. How is it providing the most value? What is it that I do not have to touch, because I am using this?

15:37 – How would these relations work? As a frontend developer, and I do not want to learn Sequel, how would that might look like; currently or in the future? How do you extract that knowledge?

16:18 – Yes, it is not an easy solution to solve. Nader goes into detail about how he would approach this situation.

18:26 – AJ: Are these resolvers written in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)?

22:04 – Acronym fun!

22:45 – [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

23:51 – Summarizing these pasts 20-some-minutes: Off-Storage, [AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/),[Landis](https://sites.google.com/site/landismodel/developers), and others are what people are using Amplify for. New Question/New Topic: Simplify.

25:45 – [AWS MOBILE](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/) – is not mobile specific.

26:44 – If you are using [Angular](https://angular.io), we have a plugin in [Angular](https://angular.io) to help you. We also have that for React and [Vue](https://vuejsdevelopers.com) as well.

27:52 – [Advertisement](https://sentry.io/welcome/)

28:56 – What should we be talking about?

29:04 – Let’s talk about Amazon’s Lex, [Chat Bot](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=lex_2017&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=awns_lex_b&sc_content=chatbot_p&sc_detail=amazon%2520chatbot&sc_category=lex&sc_segment=209039218013&sc_matchtype=p&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!209039218013!p!!g!!amazon%2520chatbot&ef_id=W5RTKgAAAUa7GPf1:20180908230815:s). Nader goes into full detail of this service.

33:52 – [Apple T.V.](https://www.apple.com/tv/)

34:00 – AJ: Sounds like this is more platform/ more agnostic than getting different things to come together, and the Microsoft one is more hybrid and the Amazon one is more open?

35:13 – Joe, let’s go back to what you had to ask.

35:28 – Nader, you talked about [PUSH notifications](https://www.biznessapps.com/blog/what-is-a-push-notification/) earlier. What is [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)?

36:30 – Is this like traditional hooks? Or custom?

37:25 – What is the “stuff” that gets you up in the morning and gets you excited to go to work at AWS?

38:40 – Nader: I really had no desire to change career paths, but it happened.

41:30 – AJ: I totally agree with the idea in that finding the common patterns, so that way someone on the lower-level can participate. AJ wants a platform that is open or purchase that can offer some of these benefits. It could be open-source or you used to buy the different tools.

43:27 AJ: What about for the hobbyist?

43:40 – Nader: I agree, that would be really nice. I can’t think of any free services that would be nice.

44:03 AJ – Not free in “free,” but “free” towards the idea of “free speech.” They would all be available and you get to choose what works well for you.

45:00 – **SHOUTOUT to LISTENERS:** Have an idea about this? Shoot the panel an e-mail!

45:33 – Hopefully this opens the listeners’ eyes to what’s out there.

45:48 – Cloud services.

46:55 – Innovation follows niche markets. When something gets big and established, innovation comes to a plateau. The innovation will develop in a new economic area like hydraulics. AJ thinks a niche will develop.

49:03 – Is there anything, Dabit, which you would like to talk about?

49:15 – Can we talk about [AI as a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-technical-content/latest/aws-overview/artificial-intelligence-services.html)?

51:10 – Nader saw a demonstration recently.

52:26 – Hearing these implications is so cool, but when it comes to ML a panelist dabbled a little bit. He watched some videos, unless you want to devote a year or two to learning it then it’s too complex to put together. Do you have to be genius-level to get through?

53:29 – ML you are passing data. Nader is not quite sure.

56:00 Nader just did a blog post  check-it-out!

56:49 – Let’s do Picks!
