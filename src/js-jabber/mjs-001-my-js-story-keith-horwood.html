<h2>My JS Story Keith Horwood</h2>
On today's episode of My JS Story, Charles Max Wood welcomes Keith Horwood. Keith was previously on ep 220 of Jabbascript Jabber talking about Nodal. On this, the first episode of My JS Story, we'll find out more about Keith and what makes him tick as a programmer.
<h2>When Did Keith Start?</h2>
Keith started programming when he was 10 or 11 but went about it all wrong. It was fun and he enjoyed the experimentation working with Visual Basic 5.0.

Keith's dad was a software engineer and would sit him down at the computer and show him how to write some basic code. Keith would change the background form and make it flash. He was mesmerized.

With just a bit of instruction, his dad would leave him to experiment and play around. When his dad returned a couple of hours later and Keith had created his first simple application.
<h2>The Joy of Creation</h2>
Keith looked forward to the weekends in front of the computer at his dad's house. No matter what age you get involved in programming, Keith says it's about experimentation, the joy of creation and seeing what you can build.
<h2> What Does it Take to Get Started?</h2>
Anyone can open up their web browser console and begin programming. It's that easy to see your creations come to life. It's amazing to Keith. Plus, there is a whole Jabbascript community out there for support.

Keith spent his early years in web development working on PHP. He thinks that most hard-core backend developers view Jabbascript as a joke. He viewed it as a toy that you used to create very simple things.
