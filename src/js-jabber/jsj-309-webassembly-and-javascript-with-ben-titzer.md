**Special Guests:** Ben Titzer

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists discuss WebAssembly and JavaScript with Ben Titzer. Ben is a JavaScript VM engineer and is on the [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) team at Google. He was one of the co-inventors of [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) and he now works on VM engineering as well as other things for WebAssembly. They talk about how WebAssembly came to be and when it would be of most benefit to you in your own code.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Ben intro
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- Co-inventor of [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/) (Wasm)
- Joined [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) in 2014
- [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/)
- Built a JIT compiler to make asm.js faster
- [TurboFan](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/TurboFan)
- What is the role of JavaScript? What is the role of WebAssembly?
- SIMD.js
- JavaScript is not a statically typed language
- Adding SIMD to Wasm was easier
- Easy to add things to Wasm
- Will JavaScript benefit?
- Using JavaScript with Wasm pros and cons
- Pros to compiling with Wasm
- Statically typed languages
- The more statically typed you are, the more you will benefit from Wasm
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Is WebAssembly headed towards being used in daily application?
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is investing heavily in Wasm
- WebAssembly in gaming
- And much, much more!
