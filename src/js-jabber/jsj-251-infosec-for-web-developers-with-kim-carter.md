## **InfoSec for Web Developers with Kim Carter**
On today's episode, Charles Max Wood and Aimee Knight&nbsp;discuss **InfoSec for Web Developers with Kim Carter**. Kim is a senior software engineer/architect, an information security professional, and the founder of binarymist.io. He is currently working on his book called Holistic InfoSec for Web Developers. Tune in to&nbsp;learn more on what his book is all about.
## **Front-end Security**
Most security concerns are dealt&nbsp;at the back-end. However, front-end developers could also worry about getting hacked depending on the app they are building. There are things in the front-end that you can do such as usability, which enable good user experience. As the app is built, such security issues need to be addressed at the front-end before back-end are notified about it.
## **Browser Exploits**
There are tools that help assess an app's front-end security. One is the browser exploitation framework (BeEF). It focuses on the browser to look after malicious threats. To implement BeEF, you visit&nbsp;other places online to kickoff some exploits.&nbsp;Afterwards, you&nbsp;break into a network through the browser to test its security.
## **Dealing with Malicious Attacks**
A virus can do anything it wants once it is activated, but can be dealt with using reliable programs. One example is Windows' exploitation via Parashell, which it explicitly trusts. Once a virus affects something, it bypasses the virus and beats the attack. Stay in touch with Kim:
