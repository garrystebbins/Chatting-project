<p class="p4"><span class="s4">0:00 – <a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui?utm_medium=social-paid&amp;utm_source=devchattv&amp;utm_campaign=kendo-ui-awareness-jsjabber"><span class="s3">Advertisement: KENDO UI</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:00 – Chuck: We have today Julian. Julian, please tell us why you are famous?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:10 – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-fahrer/"><span class="s3">Julian (Guest):</span></a> I am a software engineer in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:35 – Chuck: <a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-010-docker-with-julian-fahrer/"><span class="s3">We had you on Elixir Mix before</span></a> – so here you are! Give us a brief introduction – tell us about the </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:56 – Julian: About 11 hours. You can get it done in about 1 week. It’s a lot to learn. It’s a new paradigm, and I think that’s why people like it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:22 – Aimee: How did you dive into Docker? I feel that is like backend space?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:35 – Julian: I am a full stack engineer and I have been in backend, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:10 – Aimee: I know that someone has been in-charge of our Dev Ops process until the first job I’ve had. When there is a problem in the deployment, I want to unblock myself and not wait for someone else. I think it’s a valuable topic. Why Docker over the other options?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:58 – Julian: Let’s talk about what Docker is first? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:12 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:23 – Julian: Containers are a technology for us to run applications in isolation from each other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Julian talks in-detail about what contains are, what they do, he gives examples, and more. Check it out here!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:27 – Chuck: Makes sense to me. I think it’s interesting that you are talking about the dependencies. Because of the way the Docker works it’s consistent across all of your applications. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:59 – Julian. Yes, exactly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Julian talks about containers some more!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:56 – Chuck asks a question about the container, Docker, and others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:03 – Guest: You don’t have to worry about your company’s running operating system, and what you want to use – basically everything runs in the container...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:30 – Chuck: This short-circuits a lot of it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:46 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:00 – Chuck: People will use Docker if your employer mandates it. Is there a learning curve and how do you adapt it within the person’s company? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:25 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:52 – Aimee: We are using it, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:57 – Guest: Awesome!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:03 – Aimee: The only downfall is that if you have people who are NOT familiar with it – then it’s a black box for us. We can’t troubleshoot it ourselves. I want to be able to unblock from our end w/o having to go to someone else. That’s my only issue I’ve been having.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:03 – Guest: I want to see that tooling to be honest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:12 – Aimee: Can you talk about how Civil and Docker work together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:19 – Guest: Yes! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Julian answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:56 – Chuck: How much work it is to get a Docker file to get up and running? How much work would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:18 – Guest: For the development side in about an hour or two – this is if you understand it already. Putting it into production that’s a different story b/c there is a million different ways to do it. It’s hard to put a time on that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:24 – Chuck: Let’s assume they have the basic knowledge (they get how server setup takes place) is this something you could figure out in a day or so?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:47 – Guest: If you have touched Docker then you can do it in a day; if never then not really.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:02 – Guest: There might be some stones you will fall over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:39 – Panel: The part of the learning curve would be...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:52 – Guest: The idea behind the container is that the container should be disposable. You could throw it away and then start a new one and it’s fresh and clean. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Guest continues with his answer.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:20 – Chuck: I have seen people do this with their database engine. If you need to upgrade your database then they grab their container...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:55 – Guest: You don’t have to worry about setting it up - its provided in the container and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:09 – <i>Chuck asks a question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:17 – Guest: For production, I would go with a hosted database like RJS, Azure, or other options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Guest continues. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:13 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:20 – Guest: If it dies then you need to...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:30 – Chuck: We talked about an idea of these containers being something you can hand around in your development team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>Chuck asks a question. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:50 – <i>Guest answers the question. He talks about tooling, containers, web frontend, and more. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:48 – Guest asks Aimee a question: Are you using Compost?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:50 – Aimee: I don’t know b/c that is a black box for us. I don’t know much about our Docker setup. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:00 – Guest to Aimee: Can I ask you some questions? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:14 – <i>Guest is giving Aimee some hypothetical situations and asks what their process is like. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:32 – <i>Aimee answers the question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:11 – Guest: You have customizing tooling to be able to do x, y, and z.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:25 – Aimee: They have hit a wall, but it’s frustrating. Our frontend and our backend are different. We are getting 500’s and it’s a black box for us. It’s the way that ops have it setup. I hate having to go to them for them to unblock us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:07 – Chuck: I have been hearing about <a href="https://kubernetes.io"><span class="s3">Kubernetes</span></a>. When will you start to see that it pays off to use it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:20 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:17 – If I have a simple app on a few different machines and front end and job servers I may not need <a href="https://kubernetes.io"><span class="s3">Kubernetes.</span></a> But if I have a lot of things that it depends on then I will need it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:35 – Guest: Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:40 – Chuck: What are the steps to using it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:45 – Guest: Step #1 you install it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest goes through the different steps to use Docker. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:23 – Aimee: It makes sense that your UI and your database don’t live in the same container, but what about your API and your database should that be separate?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:40 – Guest: Yes they should be separate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:09 – Chuck: What has your experience been with Docker – AJ or Chris?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:17 – Panel: I have used a little bit at work and so far it’s been a black box for me. I like the IDEA of it, but I probably need to take Julian’s course to learn more about it! (Aimee agrees!)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One thing I would love (from your perspective, Julian) – if I wanted to get started with this (and say I have not worked with containers before) where would I start?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">28:22 – <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"><span class="s3">Advertisement – Sentry.io</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:20 – Guest: Good question. You don’t have to be an expert (to use Docker), but you have to be comfortable with the command line, though. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:17 – Panel: Is there a dummy practice within your course? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:27 – Julian: We run our own web server and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:44 – Panel: I need to check out your course!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:04 – Guest: It is some time investment, but it’s saved me so much time already so it makes it really worth it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:38 – Panel: You are a version behind on Ruby.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:46 – Guest: ...I just want to make code and not worry about that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:04 – Chuck: Updating your server – you would update Ruby and reinstall your gems and hope that they were all up-to-date. Now you don’t have to do it that way anymore. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:37 – Guest: You know it will behave the same way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:48 – Guest: I have some experience with Docker. I understand its value. I guess I will share my frustrations. Not in Docker itself, but the fact that there is a need for Docker...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:06 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:12 – Panel: We need someone to come up with...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:40 – Panel: It’s not standard JavaScript. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:51 – Chuck: One question: How do you setup multiple stages of Docker? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:12 – Guest: The recommended way is to have the same Docker file used in the development sate and through to production. So that way it’s the same image. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:00 – Panel: ...you must do your entire configuration via the environmental variables.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:29 – Chuck asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:36 – Panel: If you are using <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com"><span class="s3">Heroku</span></a> or <a href="https://circleci.com"><span class="s3">Circle CI</span></a>...there is a page...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:11 – Guest and Chuck go back-and-forth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:17 – Chuck: Gottcha. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:18 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:52 – Chuck: I have seen systems that have hyberized things like using Chef Solo and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">You do your basic setup then use Chef Solo – that doesn’t’ make sense to me. Have you seen people use this setup before?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:20 – Guest: I guess I wouldn’t do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:30 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:36 – Guest: Only reason I would do that is that it works across many different platforms. If it makes your setup easier then go for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:14 – Chuck: Docker Hub – I want to mention that. How robust is that? Can you put private images up there? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:38 – Guest: You can go TOTALLY nuts with it. You could have private and public images. Also, your own version. Under the hood it’s called container registry. Yeah, you can change images, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:22 – Chuck: Should I use container registry or a CI system to build the Docker system and use it somewhere else?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:35 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:24 – Chuck: Where can people find your Docker course? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:30 – Guest: <a href="https://learndocker.online"><span class="s3">LEARN DOCKER ONLINE!</span></a> We are restructuring the prices. Make sure to check it out.</span></p>
