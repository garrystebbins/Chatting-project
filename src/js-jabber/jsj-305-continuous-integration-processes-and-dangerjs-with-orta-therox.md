**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Aimee Knight
- Joe Eames
- AJ O'Neal
- **Special Guests:** Orta Therox

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists talk about the tool [Danger](https://danger.systems/js/) with Orta Therox. Danger allows you to create cultural rules about your pole request workflow. They discuss what Danger is, how it works, and how it can help you to catch errors and speed up code review. Danger lets you erase discussions so that you can focus on the things that you should really be focusing on, like the code. They also compare Danger to other ways of doing test converge.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- What is [DangerJS](https://danger.systems/js/)?
- Think of it as being on the PR level
- Provides an eval context
- Used on larger projects
- [React,](https://reactjs.org/) [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [RxJS](https://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
- Experimenting with moving Danger onto a server
- Danger can run as a linting step
- Pre-commit hooks
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- How do you use Danger on your own machine?
- [Danger Ruby](https://danger.systems/ruby/) vs [Danger JS](https://danger.systems/js/)
- NPM install
- How is using Danger better that other ways of test coverage?
- What kinds of rules can you write for this system?
- Can use with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- React Storybooks
- Retrospectives
- And much, much more!
