  "bio": "Mike Schutte is always uncomfortable describing himself in third person. He helps build front-endy things with all of his remote friends at TED. In 2016, he pivoted his career aspirations from sociology to software development. When not refactoring code that doesn't need refactoring, you might find him running laps on Detroit's Belle Isle, playing an Avett Brothers song, or experimenting with water temperature and ground size for his pour-over ritual.",
