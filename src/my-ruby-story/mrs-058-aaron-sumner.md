**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Aaron Sumner

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Aaron Sumner. Aaron is a senior software engineer at [O’Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/) as well as runs the blog [Everyday Rails](https://everydayrails.com/) and wrote a book entitled [_Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec_](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec). He first got into programming when his school got a computer and he took a computer class at a local community college that he took in order to learn how to write games. They talk about how he got into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), what he is proud of contributing to the community, why he decided to write his book, and more!
