 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Jerome Hardaway

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles speaks with Jerome Hardaway. Jerome used to be a panelist on [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) and loved the ability to share his knowledge and interact with so many people from the community. He first got into programming by accident when he couldn’t find a job after becoming a veteran. He saw a commercial about job opportunities in coding, ended up finding a book on SQL and taught himself how to program. They talk about where he ran across Ruby on Rails, what he has worked on that he is particularly proud of, what he is doing currently, and more!
