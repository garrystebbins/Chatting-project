 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Takashi Kokubun

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Takashi Kokubun. Takashi is a template engine hobbyist, is currently working on the [JIT Compiler](https://github.com/k0kubun/llrb) for Ruby 2.6, and is a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application engineer at [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com/). He first got into programming in his first year at university where he learned C in his first part-time job. They talk about why he decided to work with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), the first thing he built with it, and how you would write a templating system. They also touch on what he is working on now, what his plans are for the future, and more!
