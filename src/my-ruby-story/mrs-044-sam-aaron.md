**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Sam Aaron

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Sam Aaron. Sam is a programmer who likes to try to get other programmers involved and programming in creative ways. Currently, he has been making music with programming with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and teaching children how to do so as well. He first really got into programming when he picked up a graphing calculator when he was in school and would program games and pictures on it. They talk about what led him to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and what led him to create Sonic Pi.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
