**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Benjamin Wood

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Benjamin Wood. Ben and his brother Josh own a consultancy company together called [Hint](https://hint.io/), where they specialize in upgrading [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) apps and run [UpgradeRails.com](https://www.upgraderails.com/). He first got into programming because he was interested in computer hardware and built a computer out of spare parts for fun as a child. They talk about what led him to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), what he has learned in throughout his life, especially with running a business, and much more!
