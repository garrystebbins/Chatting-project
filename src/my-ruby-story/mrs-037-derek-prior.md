**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Derek Prior

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Derek Prior. Derek speaks at conferences more often and is now a development director at [Thought Bot](https://thoughtbot.com/). He first got into programming when was 7 or 8 when he got an Apple IIGS for Christmas and he started messing around with writing basic code. This really got him interested in how video games and systems worked behind the scenes and led to his interest in programming. In high school, he took programming classes and found he was actually good at it and decided to pursue programming in college. Once he was hired at Thought Bot, his developing skills really took off and he has been there for almost five years now.
