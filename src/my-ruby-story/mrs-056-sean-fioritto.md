 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Sean Fioritto

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Sean Fioritto. Sean is a developer that five years ago quit his job to do his own thing and work on different projects such as [_Sketching with CSS_](https://www.sketchingwithcss.com/), [Angular Escape Plan](https://training.planningforaliens.com/angular/) training, and consulting. He first got into programming when he had an idea to create things such as rooms and spells in his MOO game. They talk about how he got into professional style programming, how he got into drawing with CSS, why he created the Angular Escape Plan, and more!
