### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of My Ruby Story, Charles hosts Luca Guidi, Senior Software Developer at [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/) and creator of [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/) ( previously Lotus framework) from Italy. Listen to Luca on the podcast Ruby Rogues on this&nbsp;[episode](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-361-ruby-elapsed-time-with-luca-guidi/) and this [episode](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/228-the-lotus-framework-with-luca-guidi/). Luca grew up playing video games and took his first programming class when he was 12. His dream was to become a programmer. After studying Information Technology, Luca started working as a programmer and Ruby felt the most natural to him. He found that Rails was a great to start off applications with but not necessarily maintain with. So he created Ruby web framework Lotus which he renamed as &nbsp;[Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/) after IBM created software named Lotus as well. Luca is currently working on Hanami preparing for a 2.0 alpha release, he will also be a speaker at the[RubyDay2019](https://2019.rubyday.it/) conference that will be held in Verona in April.
