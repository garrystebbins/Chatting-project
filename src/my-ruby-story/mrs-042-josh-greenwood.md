**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Josh Greenwood

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Josh Greenwood. Josh was recently on [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-347-theres-nothing-new-sun-justin-searls-josh-greenwood) and he works for a consulting company called [Test Double](https://testdouble.com/), where he works remotely with clients all across the country. He first got into programming because he was always around computers because of his Dad, and he always loved playing video games. His first real exposure to programming was when he found an HTML book on his Dad’s bookshelf and he used it to build a website. They talk about what led him to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), what made him fall in love with programming, and much more!
