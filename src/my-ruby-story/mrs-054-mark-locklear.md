**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Mark Locklear

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Mark Locklear. Mark first got into programming when there wasn’t a lot of opportunities for him to continue to work in quality assurance and he decided he wanted a change of career, so he went to community college to learn programming. They talk about how he was first exposed to [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), where he is working currently, and what was it about Rails that got him excited. They also touch on what made him want to move from quality assurance, how he mentors his students at the community college, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
