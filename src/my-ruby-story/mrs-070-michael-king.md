**Panel:** [Charles Max Wood](https://twitter.com/cmaxw?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor)

**Guest:** Michael King

This week on My Ruby Story, Chuck talks with Michael King who is a developer, an enthusiast for natural languages, developing, and mathematics. Charles and Michael talk about his background, and past/current projects that Michael is working on right now. Other topics of discussion include Ruby, Rails, Audacity, PHP, RubyMotion, and React Native. Check it out!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

0:00 – [Get A Coder Job!](https://getacoderjob.com/)

0:58 – Chuck: Say “hi” Michael! Introduce yourself.

1:12 – Michael: I am a big language learner: Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese. I learned through T.V. and music. I decided to build an app that helped with languages. I started doing it.

1:50 – Chuck: You hired a developer and had no idea what the developer what was doing. How do you make that transition? They just go with it – right? How did you decide: no, I have to understand THIS.

2:25 – Guest: It’s either I am really into it or I am NOT into it. I have been always very good with mathematics. The computer broke when I was in school and the only option we had were these...He was writing all these variables and I loved variables.

_The guest talks about Ruby, Rails, and Audacity!_

4:08 – Chuck: You talk about natural languages – I see the correlation sometimes and sometimes I don’t. I learned French in school, and then I became fluent in Italian during my Mormon missionary trips.

4:56 – Guest: I am reading this book right now and you have to understand the technicians’ role in order to help lead him.

_The guest talks about the differences between coding, natural languages, and mathematics._

5:50 – Chuck: Did you let your developer go? Or did you keep him around?

6:03 – Guest: I let him go actually b/c he was on for a part-time basis. I started coding myself. I got help from friends and I got help from a lot of other people. I would ask them tons of questions and form a friendly relationship with them. From there, it snowed-ball from there!

6:57 – Guest: From that experience, I learned a lot. If I had to REDO what I did originally, then I would have done the following things differently...

7:44 – Chuck: I can identify with that – I was a freelancer for 8-9 years. I would build something and then they say: that’s not what we hired you to build.

8:10 – Guest: They wonder why they are getting this feedback?

8:22- Chuck: Why Ruby on Rails?

8:27 – Guest: I didn’t know the difference between mobile frameworks and web frameworks.

9:01 – Chuck: Yeah I don’t like the word “dumb” either.

9:09 – Guest: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) was very smooth and I liked it. I got addicted to the process through the [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) way and the Ruby syntax.

9:46 – Chuck: Same for me. I have done [PHP](https://www.php.net) before but when I got into [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) it naturally flowed into the way I wanted to work on stuff. I get it.

10:12 – Chuck: What are you working on now?

10:19 – Guest: This project that I have been working on now for 1.5 years.

11:41 – Chuck: You talked about how you picked up [React Native.](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

11:52 – Guest: Yes, yes.

12:39 – Chuck: How did you settle on [React Native?](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

12:50 – _Guest talks about the Spanish and English languages._

13:25 – Chuck: I am curious – why didn’t you go with [RubyMotion?](https://www.rubymotion.com)

13:34 – Guest: I didn’t know anyone that could help me honestly. Also, I didn’t think it was going to be EASY to learn for me.

14:02 – Chuck: Is [Reactive Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) your main focus?

14:08 – Guest: No building just designing and putting it in front of people. I want to get a prototype to get more funding. I want to know EXACTLY what we are building.

14:40 – Chuck: For entrepreneurs, any advice for anything to get this rolling?

14:56 – Guest: If I had to do it again I would draw it out on paper and figure out how to get to MVP right away. I would try to get validation right away from not building too much

15:47 – Chuck: I am working on a service to help podcasters. They see that that I run 15 shows through DevChat.TV. If I can solve those three problems then I am golden: monetization and/or production. For scheduling guests it’s a pain point for most podcasters.

17:36 – Chuck: Some of the validation for me is talking to people through conferences and other venues. Main question is: What are you doing for scheduling? It takes a bunch of time.

Post to where people will get your content.

Have your guests promote it, too!

20:05 – Guest: Inviting people to the show.

20:13 – Chuck: This is the 16<sup>th</sup> interview this week so far! To give you an idea!

21:16 – Guest: You lost me along the way only b/c I don’t do podcasting. You know the problem b/c you are doing it, and you are within the field.

21:42 – Chuck: The more I talk to people the more I get ideas and such.

22:00 – Guest.

22:06 – Chuck: They are worried that their ideas are going to get stolen.

22:15 – Chuck: It’s interesting to see where it goes. I have 2 more interviews after this.

Michael, you see and say: what solutions can I provide?

23:03 – Chuck: Did we get into your mobile app then?

23:14 – Guest: It was really hard for me, but now I love coding. Getting it in front of people and testing it. I am trying to keep my education going. I learn by doing and learning by being thrown in to the fire. I am doing a free code camp now. Any suggestions, Chuck that you could offer?

24:35 – Chuck: Learning how to prioritize. What are you aiming at, and what goal are you trying to achieve? I want to make a video course on HOW to stay current?

25:12 – Chuck: Where can people find you?

25:18 – Guest: Twitter! There really isn’t an easy way to find me online – something I should probably fix.

25:28 – [Advertisement – Fresh Books!](https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&ag=freshbooks+%252Bx&kw=freshbooks&campaignid=717543354&adgroupid=51893696397&kwid=kwd-298507762065&dv=c&ntwk=g&crid=285105591548&source=GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8viYt8GL3gIVj4dpCh1UVgrBEAAYASAAEgK1afD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CL34x7jBi94CFVO6TwodjvwGtA)
