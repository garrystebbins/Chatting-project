**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

0:00 – [Get A Coder Job!](http://getacoderjob.com/)

0:52 – Chuck: Hello! Our guest is Kerri Miller – say Hi!

1:00 – Guest: Hi!

1:06 – Chuck: Tell us who you are and where you work?

1:13 – Guest: I live in Seattle.

1:36 – Chuck: We had you on past episodes [RR 191](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/191-rr-the-developer-happiness-team-with-kerri-miller/) and [RR 261](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/261-rr-networking-without-networking-with-kerri-miller/). Tell us about your work!

2:10 – Guest: I have been a remote-worker for about 5 years now.&nbsp;

2:30 – Chuck: Let’s focus on you and how you got into programming and what you’ve contributed into the community.&nbsp; How did you get into programming?

2:45 – Guest: I had early access to computers. We also had the Thermal Printer!

I went into theater and dance and then came back into programming.

Kerri talks about sound boards that were using computers through her art world.

4:20 – Chuck: I love how people come from different backgrounds.

5:01 – Guest: Yeah you need to have other skillsets outside of being a computer programmer. What do you bring in and what do you have at the very beginning of your career and then you fill in those blanks as you go along.

5:33 – Chuck: Yep exactly.

5:47 – Guest: I am interested to see how my stage career helps my developer career!

7:35 – Chuck.

7:39 – Guest: Some people need walk-up music.

7:51 – Chuck: How did you get into Ruby?

8:00 – Guest: I was the only person that had heard about the Internet, so that’s how I got the job! I went to Barnes & Noble and read books; kids: that is an actual place!

9:24 – Chuck: You are still using Ruby right?

9:26 – Guest: Yes I am! I have explored GO and other languages, too, b/c that helps my skills with Ruby.

10:14 – Chuck: What made you switch? How do you decide to make that switch?

10:26 – Guest: This book really helped me: “Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby.” It invigorated my love for programming.

11:15 – Chuck: How long ago was that?

11:20 – Guest: About 7 years ago.

11:37 – Chuck: Some of the things you’ve done is conference organizing and speaking. Anything else?

11:50 – Guest answers the question.

13:17 – Chuck: What were your favorite talks to give and where?

13:30 – Guest: It really is hard to choose. I liked the one in [Bath, UK last year: “Is Ruby Dead?”](https://youtu.be/v3RRuUy8E6U)

15:00 – Chuck: Where do you see Ruby going? What’s the future like for Ruby?

15:10 – Guest: I think there are neat things that are happening in Ruby 3.

16:08 – Chuck: What other conferences are you involved with?

16:14 – Guest: [Open Source & Feelings.](https://www.osfeels.com) (The guest goes into detail about what this conference has to offer!)

17:36 – Chuck: What should I be looking for there at [CES (2019)?](https://www.ces.tech/Conference.aspx)

17:52 – Guest answers.

18:39 – Guest: I have 6 [Echos & Alexas](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011) in the house – do I need those many – probably not.

19:21 – Chuck: I think the same thing about giving / not giving my fingerprint to the government vs. Apple.

19:43 – Guest.

20:06 – Chuck: What are you working on now?

20:10 – Guest: If you have a problem with Ruby – I help with the Q&A and bug-support. Working on 2019 conferences, too!

20:43 – Chuck: Picks!

20:50 – [Advertisement – Fresh Books!](https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&ag=freshbooks+%252Bx&kw=freshbooks&campaignid=717543354&adgroupid=51893696397&kwid=kwd-298507762065&dv=c&ntwk=g&crid=285105591548&source=GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8viYt8GL3gIVj4dpCh1UVgrBEAAYASAAEgK1afD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CL34x7jBi94CFVO6TwodjvwGtA)
