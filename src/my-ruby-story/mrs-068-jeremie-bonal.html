<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>Guest:</b> Jérémie Bonal</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This week on My Ruby Story, Chuck talks with <a href="https://medium.com/@aquajvalin"><span class="s4">Jérémie Bonal</span></a> who works at <a href="https://ekylibre.com"><span class="s4">Ekylibre</span></a>. He is a web developer and he has been using Ruby for the past few years now. They talk about Jérémie’s background, Ruby, Ekylibre, past/current projects, and so much more! Check it out! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s6">0:00 – <a href="http://getacoderjob.com/"><span class="s2">Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">1:05 – Chuck: We are talking with <a href="https://medium.com/@aquajvalin"><span class="s2">Jérémie Bonal</span></a> today. Tell us who you are!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">1:21 – Guest: I am a web developer and I’ve been writing Ruby for about 2 ½ years now. I’ve been writing code now for 5 – 6 years. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">1:54 – Chuck: I love writing in Ruby, too. Let’s get into your story. What’s the Ruby community like in France? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">2:23 – Guest: It’s pretty dispersed in the town that I am living in right now (Bordeaux). We meet up through Meetups and chatting about everything and drinking beer. There are more Ruby communities in Paris. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">3:23 – Chuck: Maybe one day I will make it out to Bordeaux. My grandmother was French and I thought it would be cool to see the different parts of France. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">3:45 – Guest: Cycle through France.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">3:53 – Chuck: My grandmother grew-up near Lyon. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">4:02 – Guest: France is pretty small compared to the U.S. You can fit several towns in a single trip.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">4:21 – Chuck: I do have a funny connection. When I lived in Italy for a few years I would show them a map of Utah and they thought CA was close to UT. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">5:03 – Guest: Yes, it’s hard to conceptualize. From what I’ve heard it could be a road trip for Americans. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around that.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">5:40 – Chuck talks about Disneyland and family topics. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Chuck: Let’s talk about you and your Ruby story. Are you hiring and where can they go?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:20 – Guest: Yes we are! You can find us on our <a href="https://ekylibre.com"><span class="s2">website.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:57 – Chuck: Let’s talk about you – how did you get into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">7:00 – Guest: When I was young with calculators. My friends made games with it and it blew my mind. I tried to make sense of what the key words meant. Nothing worked and I got real puzzled. I went to college and in the first semester you didn’t choose a major – you just do a bit of everything. You learn some engineering, chemistry, math, etc. so people could find what they really wanted to do. I worked in Python and worked with graphs and all of those concepts. This is when I got into it. I planned on going into chemistry, but all my friends were getting into programming. They kept saying: keep doing programming. I caved-in and the rest is history. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:02 – Chuck: What languages have you worked with? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:09 – <i>Guest lists the different languages. Guest started with Python 2.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:30 – Chuck: We started with Java and C++. It’s interesting to compare the differences there. As we are talking about this – a lot of people think they NEED a computer science degree and others say: nah! I am curious what advantages did it give you?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:12 – Guest: I was disillusioned about the whole thing. They taught me a lot but I didn’t know anything valuable. I learned Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I started building web apps and I got joy out of it. I thought I didn’t have any purpose with my new degree. I noticed in the conversations with my colleagues (who don’t have computer science background) I saw that I could solve patterns and I had a better vocabulary. I saw that I could apply it and that felt good. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:37 – Chuck: Interesting. I found my degree helped with the low-level stuff and helped me to solve problems. I learned on the job, though, too. I feel like if you need the structured environment of a college environment – go for it! Or do a boot camp, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">13:21 – Guest: I learned Ruby and Ruby on Rails through a boot camp. I wished there were boot camps for my computer science courses. To solve MP this and that; getting into the basics and building a sold foundation in computer science in a short period of time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:06 – Chuck: I’ve thought about creating that curriculum. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:36 – Chuck: It’s an interesting conversation to have. I think the boot camps will force the universities to adapt. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">15:01 – Guest: Yes, the disconnect is pretty staggering. It must be kind of similar.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">15:20 – Chuck: You graduated and you learned Ruby through boot camps? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">15:29 – Guest: I felt like I didn’t know how to do anything constructive or valuable. I meld around for a while – I went to be an English teacher and other jobs. I found out about a boot camp in Bordeaux and I went to that. It was going to teach Web apps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought taking it would make my CV stronger. It was 9 weeks of Ruby, Ruby, and Ruby! Then the last 2 weeks building an actual app. I fell in-love and found my passion.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">16:55 – Chuck: That mirrors my experience well. A friend introduced me to the Lamp Stack and then it clicked that this stuff is “cool.” Sounds like you made the same connect that I did. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">17:46 – Guest: Yes, that’s how it went for me, too. The last few weeks we made an app and it was a travel app. It blew my mind that we made it in only 2 weeks and that people could use it!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">19:05 – Chuck: Same thing for me. We were answering emails out of Thunder Bird, and we kept stepping on each other.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:18 – Guest: I think my favorite is: I have a problem right now, and I can solve it myself. I can build a basic tool that will make my life easier.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:40 – Chuck: Yep, that’s what I am doing right now. I am building in scheduling and all sort of stuff. The app is awesome and it feels like you have a super power.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">21:10 – Guest: Yeah, it does whatever you want it to do.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">21:20 – Chuck: What projects have you worked on? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">21:22 – Guest: The project I mentioned about the travel itineraries. Then I worked with some classmates on another project around pharmaceuticals. It was cool to solve a problem. Then I played a small web player. I tried Raspberry and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org"><span class="s2">Raspberry Pi</span></a>, and I was trying to build...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Since then I have been working with my current company. I was missing some parts of college b/c one of my projects was a graph gem. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">I tried other things, too. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">24:45 – Chuck: I know that Hanaumi is popular in the European market vs. U.S. market.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:00 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">26:00 – Chuck: I have some theories as to WHY that is. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:26 – Guest: I have a friend who moved to Elixir and never tried Hanaumi. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">26:42 – Chuck: I have been playing with Elixir somewhat. I wanted to understand what people were experiencing. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">27:02 – Guest: I liked the idea that...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">27:48 – Chuck: What are you working on these days?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">28:01 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">29:53 – Chuck: When you find the position of CEO or my job you learn a lot about that stuff. When you are running a business you learn about marketing and other business topics. You talked about replicating a gem. What did you learn through that process? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">30:30 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">32:20 – Chuck: You are learning more about management? What resources do you use? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">32:26 – Guest: I read a lot of Medium articles. I am a huge fan of management articles, and Basecamp. Also, your newsletter, Chuck! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">33:30 – Chuck: Anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">33:33 – Guest: Social Platforms – Medium. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">33:58 – Chuck: Where can we find you? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">34:00 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s6">34:50 – <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=freshbooks+%252Bx&amp;kw=freshbooks&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;kwid=kwd-298507762065&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8viYt8GL3gIVj4dpCh1UVgrBEAAYASAAEgK1afD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CL34x7jBi94CFVO6TwodjvwGtA"><span class="s2">Advertisement – Fresh Books!</span></a> </span></p>
