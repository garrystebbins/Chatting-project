### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of My Ruby Story, Charles hosts Tung Nguyen, President and Founder of BoltOps AWS Cloud Infrastructure Consultancy, a Bay Area based DevOps infrastructure consultancy. Tung is also the creator of Ruby on Jets. Listen to Tung on the podcast Ruby Rogues [here](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-399-jets-ruby-serverless-framework-with-tung-nguyen/). Tung majored in Electrical Engineering in college but didn’t really enjoy working as an electrical engineer so decided to teach himself programming. He started with Perl language and eventually switched to Ruby. Currently, Tung is working full time for BoltOps consultancy and develops and maintains Ruby on Jets along with other open source projects. When he is not working, Tung takes care of his 3 children. Listen to the show to find out more about Tung’s journey as a developer and what he thinks the pros and cons of working from home are.
