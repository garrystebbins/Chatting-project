0:55 – Chuck: This week I am talking with [Paweł Dąbrowski](https://github.com/rubyhero) who was on [episode 366.](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-366-build-your-own-rspec-a-gentle-metaprogramming-intro-with-pawel-d%25C4%2585browski/) Give us a brief description of who you are, please.

1:25 – Guest: I run a company and I am here b/c of the article I wrote. It was a nice introduction to...programming. I write in my [blog](https://pdabrowski.com/blog/articles) and have written a few gems. I created a course how to build Ruby Flow. Also, I create Ruby code every day. I think that’s it.

2:19 – Chuck: I am curious, how did you get into programming?

2:30 – Guest: It all started in school when he asked me to create a website using HTML code. I fell in-love with it.

I didn’t want to give up and figured it all boils down to: “how bad do you want it?”

4:33 – Chuck: Yeah it was PHP for me, too. I could do dynamic things with this. I was a computer science major, and to build something REAL was amazing.

5:04 – Guest: Yes, when something works it’s amazing.&nbsp;

5:25 – Chuck: Yeah, when you realize you left out a semi-colon – oh no! In some ways, PHP was a friendly-way to do web development.&nbsp;

6:05 – Guest.

6:22 – Chuck: How old were you when you got paid for web development?

6:32 – Guest: I think I was sixteen years old and \$50.00 was a fortune for me. I felt like a millionaire. It felt great to make money for something you love to do. It wasn’t work; I just enjoyed doing it.

7:07 – Chuck: That’s the magic!

7:14 – Guest: If you are doing something you love, then it’s great!

7:24 – Chuck: How did you go from PHP to one-page apps to Ruby?

7:35 – Guest: I didn’t like PHP at some point. I fell in-love with Ruby’s syntax. I was afraid that I wasn’t going to find a job. I wrote a programmer and told him that I have “no experience and no technical training...” I didn’t think it was possible, and he said that it was possible based on the work that I put in. I remember writing code in Ruby.

9:42 – Chuck: What drew you to Ruby?

9:48 – Guest: The community and the syntax. I love writing in Ruby, and I don’t know if I will switch my languages in the future. I want to create a more active Ruby community in Poland. I want to get junior developers involved.

10:29 – Chuck: Tell us about your blog!

10:40 – Guest: I started writing every day. I started in January and kept going for three months. I thought that was crazy, and so I wrote less frequently. I thought it was a game-changing decision for me b/c it took me to a new level. I wrote more, learned more, and it has given me visibility.

11:47 – Chuck: I have talked to people in various parts of the world. People say that it could be a barrier of only English-written blogs.

12:15 – Guest: I learned English once I got serious about coding/programming. I think it’s a disadvantage if you don’t know English.

12:35 – Chuck: What are you working on now?

12:40 – Guest: I am starting this project and decided to turn-it-up b/c at first it was experimental. I wanted to move people more in the Polish community. I write about [soft skills](https://pdabrowski.com/blog/books/soft-skills-the-software-developers-life-manual) and that developers should have those skills, too.

13:22 – Chuck: This episode won’t come out for a few months. If you want to plug that – you can if you are comfortable with it.

13:44 – Guest: I want to set-up interviews, and create a dictionary so people can check single words and their meaning and see what it looks like in another language. Also, working on the content of blogs, and maybe recording a video on HOW to code. I was involved in a webinar and starting my first conference. Give the

14:56 – Chuck: Where can people find you? How about your blog?

15:05 – Guest: [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/pdabrowski_k1) [GitHub!](https://github.com/rubyhero) Blog! LinkedIn!

15:27 – Chuck: Any recommendations for people who are getting into programming?

15:42 – _Guest answers the question._

Guest: DOING and creating the stuff, and ultimately getting the experience. You can eventually find your dream job!

16:30 – Picks!
