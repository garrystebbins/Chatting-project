<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>Guest:</b> Nell Shamrell-Harrington</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This week on My Ruby Story, Chuck talks with Nell who is a principle engineer at <a href="https://www.chef.io"><span class="s4">Chef</span></a>. Check them out at <a href="https://www.chef.io"><span class="s4">Chef.Io</span></a>. She also works with Operation Code. This organization helps veterans to learn code, and helps them get a technical job. Check out today’s episode where Chuck and Nell discuss Ruby, Rust, and much more! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">2:00 – Chuck: <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/105-rr-regular-expressions-with-nell-shamrell/"><span class="s2">Episode 105</span></a> is another episode you’ve been on before.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">2:25 – Chuck: I want to spotlight you and talk about what you are working on. How did you get into programming? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">2:38 – Nell: I was a theater major in college. I graduated in 2007 and the big financial crisis hit in 2008. I found work at the Physics Department in Seattle. Once they found out that I knew how to code, they gave me more coding to do. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">When you are doing just the mathematics portion – you don’t see how this applies to real life. I didn’t pursue it because I didn’t see how it worked in the real world. Then I saw eventually how my theater background really helped me with coding because you have to be super creative. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">After that (this is when I got into Ruby) my roommate in college sent me a message. She was working with Ruby, too, and she wanted to bring me on as a junior developer. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">5:55 – Chuck: It’s interesting, too, to see what you just said. Not seeing the real-world application with some of that stuff. I can relate to that. I wanted to get into IT after college. The other thing is that it was someone you KNEW to get you into Ruby. People get into a specific framework because of someone that they knew/know. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:54 – Nell: Yes, it’s the personal testimonies that help people make those decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">7:13 – Chuck: It was someone that you KNEW that helped you get X job. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">7:24 – Nell: Yes, in Operation Code, too. Take a look at this candidate (normally you wouldn’t look at them b/c of their CV) and take a chance on them.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">8:09 – Chuck: One thing that I am curious about what’s been your favorite thing to work on with Ruby?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">8:38 – Nell: I worked on the supermarket product. Cookbook is a chef recipe for infrastructure...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">We weren’t just running a site that people were using. They were saying: we love it, but we are behind a firewall. They couldn’t use the public one and they wanted a private one. The answer was: Yes! That was the first time I worked on software – packaged and distributed. I loved the breadth of the industries that it had an affect on. It was cool to see different industries use my work through a Ruby on Rails application. Ruby does scale!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:42 – Chuck: Let’s talk about your work at Chef. You worked on Supermarket and then what was the distributed part to it?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">11:05 – Nell: Chef Omnibus was the tool we used. You could take that package and install it on the infrastructure...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">11:33 – Chuck: I worked at a university for a while. The work I did was that the access to the Internet was limited. Chef would have been nice! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">11:58 – Chuck: What did you do at Blue Box? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">11:59 – Nell: Software engineer there and we were a hosting company. We had a Rails application...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">I helped write the code.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:29 – Chuck: What are you working on now?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:32 – Nell: I am working on a project called Habitat. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><i>Nell talks about what THIS project is and how it functions. Check it out! </i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:20 – Chuck: How did you get into Operation Code?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:26 – Nell: Both my parents were air force operators. I wanted to but I had a physical limitation so I couldn’t. I grew up in military culture from 0-14 years old. After that I realized in my 20’s I really missed it. After the military it’s scary because you don’t have (maybe) a sense of purpose like you did in the military. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">She asked how she could help and someone referred her to Operation Code. She realized she could be an asset and help these veterans. She works with close to 3,000 veterans to help them give a purpose after military life. They learn code and then hopefully find a technical job. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">17:13 – Chuck: I spent some years around that life, too, when I was a missionary overseas. My brother-in-law was medically discharged. You see this change and it can be scary for them. You wind up in this position and you want to help. I admire this. These folks have sacrificed for us so let’s make a difference for them, too.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">18:35 – Nell: My friend said that she didn’t like it when people thanked her for her service. She said that so many warzones it seems empty. When she heard this it was powerful to her.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">19:40 – Chuck: How can people get involved?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">19:43 – Nell: Operation Code – Hit the JOIN link. You can sign-up to be a volunteer. The slack community is where all the magic happens. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:24 – Chuck: Anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:28 – Nell: Habitat is written in Rust. I haven’t done tons in Ruby right now. But what I am known in Ruby is for regular expressions. People have told me that it has helped them a lot. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">22:14 – Nell: Regular expressions can be a lot of fun but they are mind numbing at first. Seeing an example can help. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">22:33 – Chuck: Habitat is written in Rust. What’s that transition like from Ruby to Rust?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">22:49 – Nell: I took a Latin course. Learning Rust was like learning Latin in that it’s a HUGE learning curve. However, in both that I stopped fighting with the language. And stepped back to see why it was doing what it’s doing. In Rust there is no Garbage Collector. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">My Ruby experience did give me a leg-up. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><i>Nell continues to talk about the differences between Rust and Ruby. </i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">24:30 – Chuck: Which language do you like better? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">24:34 – Nell: Personally, Ruby but for this project <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/"><span class="s2">Rust!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">24:45 – Chuck: We were talking about the tradeoffs between...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:01 – Nell: Yes, choose the language that works for THAT project and for your team.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:17 – Chuck: How can people find you? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:23 – Nell: <a href="https://twitter.com/nellshamrell"><span class="s2">Twitter.</span></a> I check it throughout the day, so feel free to DM me. <a href="https://github.com/nellshamrell"><span class="s2">GitHub</span></a>, too. </span></p>
