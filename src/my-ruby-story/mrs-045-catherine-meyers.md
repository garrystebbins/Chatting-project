**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Catherine Meyers

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Catherine Meyers. Catherine first got into programming after a significant career change from being an opera singer to being a developer. Friends of hers suggested that she begin a programming career and she hasn’t looked back since. They talk about boot camps, such as [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/), the importance of life-long learning, how she got into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and why she loves the language so much.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
