**MRS 050: Jacob Stoebel**

**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Jacob Stoebel

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Jacob Stoebel. Jacob is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) developer and he works for a small company that works with publishers. Jacob first got into programming in high school when he took a computer science class where he messed around with [Pascal](https://www.pascal-programming.info/index.php) and C++. He got back into programming after college when he went back to school for programming to try to make his data entry job easier. They talk about his journey pushing the boundaries with technology, how he went about starting his programming career, and more!
