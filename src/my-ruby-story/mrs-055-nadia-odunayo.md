**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Nadia Odunayo

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Nadia Odunayo. Nadia was previously on [Ruby Rogues Episode 264](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/264-rr-code-hospitality-with-nadia-odunayo/) and she used to have her own podcast called [Ruby Book Club](http://rubybookclub.com/). She first got into programming because when she was in college she launched a creative writing publication and she was frustrated that she had to keep asking others for help. This was when she started researching coding and how it all worked so that she could put her ideas into action. They talk about [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) being the first programming language she learned, the importance of learning both the frontend and the backend, her desire to run her own thing, her need to find a company that would support her learning, and more!
