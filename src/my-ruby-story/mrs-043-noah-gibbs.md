**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Noah Gibbs

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Noah Gibbs. Noah works currently at [AppFolio](https://www.appfolio.com/) as their [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) Fellow, where he does a lot of measuring and writing about Ruby performance. He also writes a lot for [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) about Ruby performance. He first got into programming when was in the third grade and he got to use an Apple II in class. In class, they had to draw on graph paper and then “program” what they drew on their computer, and this fascinated him. They also touch on what led him to Ruby, why he fell in love with it, and what he is most proud of contributing to the Ruby community.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
