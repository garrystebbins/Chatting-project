Joe Leo joins Charles Max Wood on this week's My Ruby Story. Joe is the Founder and CEO of the agile software consultancy, Def Method. He shares his journey as a developer. Joe was tutored by his uncle and learned how to code in Basic on a command line. He wanted to be in the music industry and liked math. 

He then attended New York University in the evenings to get  a Cinema degree and worked as an administrative assistant during the day where he started programming. He really enjoyed development so he decided to seek full time employment in software.

He started taking classes in JavaScript. 

Joe is currently working on holistic product development and is delving into areas such as what makes a good product manager and what makes a good product design. Charles and Joe talk about difficulties in quantifying good product management skills or writing tests and other non-coding aspects that surround making a product.
