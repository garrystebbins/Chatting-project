**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Mike Gehard

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Mike Gehard. Mike currently works for [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/) working in the [Platform Acceleration Lab](https://pivotal.io/platform-acceleration-lab). He first got into programming when he was 10 working with his Commodore 64, but really stepped up his interest after he graduated with his Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering and started working at a petrochemical refining research company, where it was very computer based. They discuss how he found his way to Ruby and how easy it is to create things with it, as well as the things that he has contributed to the Ruby community that he is proud of.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
