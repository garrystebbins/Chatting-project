 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Trae Robrock

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Trae Robrock. Trae founded and is currently the CTO of [Green Bits](https://www.greenbits.com/) which builds POS software for the legal cannabis industry. They have been in business for about 4 years now and are growing as the cannabis industry does. He first got into programming started when he was growing up and was always around computers. He started off writing clients for [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/) where he would write chat bots and code. He got into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) when he found that Twitter was written in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and noticed that he should probably learn about it so he could get a job after college. Now, he’s focusing on Green Bits and growing his team so that he can make it a successful business.
