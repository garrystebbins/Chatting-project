 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Andy Hunt

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Andy Hunt. Andy has previously been on Ruby Rogues for [Episode 277](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/277-rr-grows-method-with-andy-hunt), and is known for his book [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X), his company [The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/about), and much more. He first got into programming because of his interest in electronic music and his first RadioShack project he created, which led him to finding a book on the future of integrated circuits. They talk about how he found [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), why he wrote [_Programming Ruby_](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0), what he is working on now, and more!
