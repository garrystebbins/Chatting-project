**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Marla Brizel

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Marla Brizel. Marla works at [Test Double](https://testdouble.com/) and has been programming full time for the past four years. She first got into programming when she got a job at a startup where they helped her learn how to program for herself and she fell in love with it. They talk about her background as a project manager and the importance of empathy for the user. They then touch on how she got into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and things that she is particularly proud of contributing to the Ruby community.
