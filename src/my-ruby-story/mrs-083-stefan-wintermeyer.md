### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of My Ruby Story, Charles hosts Stefan Wintermeyer, a freelancer developer from Germany focused on Ruby on Rails, Phoenix Framework, and web performance. Listen to Stefan on the podcast Ruby Rogues [here](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-403-rails-needs-active-deployment-with-stefan-wintermeyer/). Stefan got into programming when he was 8 years old. He started with Basic and Pascal and moved onto other languages. Even though he never received a formal programming education, he liked solving problems with software and was able to make money programming so he became a developer. Currently Stefan is working on a project called [vutuv](https://www.vutuv.de/) which is an open-source alternative to LinkedIn. He has also written books and gives talks, ones that are well know in the Ruby community are [Learn Rails 5.2: Accelerated Web Development with Ruby on Rails](https://amzn.to/2U2MYWt) as well as a Cache [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uKxDVflXdI) he gave at RailsConf 2013.
