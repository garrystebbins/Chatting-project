 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Ben Orenstein

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Ben Orenstein. Ben recently just got a new job refactoring Rails apps, runs a podcast, called [The Art of Product](http://artofproductpodcast.com/), and just finished up [The Code Quality Challenge](https://www.codequalitychallenge.com/). He first got into programming when he was a Senior in high school and took a computing class at the local college where they taught him C, and he really fell in love with programming. He is really proud of his contribution to the education side of the programming world and enjoys being able to teach really complicated concepts.
