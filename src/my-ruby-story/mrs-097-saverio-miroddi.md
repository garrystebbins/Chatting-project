Saverio Miroddi joins Charles Max Wood on this week's My Ruby Story. Saverio is a systems engineer and a backend programmer at Ticketsolve. He is originally from Italy and currently lives in Germany. Saverio shares his journey as a Ruby developer and also his passions outside of work such as bouldering. 

Saverio fell in love with programming when he was 7 years old with COmmodere 64. He didn't follow up on it however until later when he was working as a consultant working as a System Administrator where he taught himself JavaScript. Later he taught himself Ruby on the job when he was working in London. 

Saverio has written several articles such as [Saverio Miroddi’s article, “An overview of Desktop Ruby GUI Development in 2018”](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/An-overview-of-ruby-gui-development-in-2018/) and [Debugging a live/stuck Ruby process](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/).
