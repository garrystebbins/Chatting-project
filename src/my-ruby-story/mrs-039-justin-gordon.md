**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Justin Gordon

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Justin Gordon. Justin first got introduced to programming when he was a kid playing video games and in Jr. High when he took some Basic programming classes. By the time he was in High School, he was learning Pascal. He has always been interested in pursuing programming except for a small time in college when he thought he wanted to pursue investment banking. He first got into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) when he went to a meetup and found a startup who were using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). They also talk about working remotely as well as [ShakaCode](https://github.com/shakacode).
