 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Henrik Joreteg

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Henrik Joreteg. Henrik has been on [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) previously discussing [&yet](https://andyet.com/) back in December of 2014 on [episode 137](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/137-jsj-yet-with-henrik-joreteg-and-phil-roberts). He has since then left &yet and now does independent consulting and works on his own projects. He first got into programming when he started a company that created online video tours for houses and he needed to teach himself programming in order to create the website. They talk about what led him to [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), what he’s proud of contributing to the community, what he is working on now, and much more!
