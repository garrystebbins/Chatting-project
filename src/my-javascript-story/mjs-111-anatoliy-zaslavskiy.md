### **Episode Summary**
Anatoliy Zaslavskiy has been interested in computers since he was 7 years old, and began his programming career in high school, doing web development in [PHP](https://php.net/) for the online community for his favorite show&nbsp; [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/). Anatoliy currently works for [Hover](https://hover.to)as a Frontend developer transforming home photos into 3D models to help visualize what the final project will look like. Anatoliy shares his journey as a developer with bipolar disorder and tells us how he restructured his career with his employer&nbsp;so he can focus on projects that he enjoys working on. This way he performs at his best and both him and Hover can benefit from his talents. Anatoliy and Charles stress the importance for companies to talk to their developers to understand their nature as both parties benefit from open and honest dialogue.
