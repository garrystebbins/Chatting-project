 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Kye Hohenberger

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Kye Hohenberger. Kye is a senior front-end engineer at [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/), where they do chaos as a service and break your stuff on purpose so that you can fix it and it hopefully won’t happen again. He also created the [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) library, which is a CSS-in-JS library. He first got into programming because his Grandpa was always working on computers and Kye was curious about how they worked. They talk about how he got into [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), what he's built in JavaScript that he’s proud of, what he’s working on now, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
