**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Lizzie Siegle

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Lizzie Siegle. Lizzie is a senior computer science major at Bryn Mawr College, works for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) as a contracting developer evangelist, and also contributes to their documentation. She first got into programming when her AP calculus teacher told some of her classmates to attend a one day all girls coding camp at Stanford and she overheard and was interested by it. She was inspired at this camp to pursue a career in coding because she loved that you can build anything with code and be creative. They talk about what got her hooked on coding, why she chose [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), why she chose to work as a developer evangelist, and more!
