<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:06 – Chuck: Tell us a brief introduction, please.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:23 – Ben: I am a lead frontend developer at <a href="https://www.politico.com"><span class="s5">Politico.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:43 – Chuck: It’s an area that can affect everyone. How did you get into developing? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:52: Ben: I had everything you can think of to develop at first. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">2:10 – Chuck: For me it was a TI90 calculator!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">2:18 – Chuck: Was it somebody or something that pushed you towards this area?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">2:32 – Ben: I wanted to change something with the theme, Googled it, and it went from there, and the Marquis Tag.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">2:51 – Chuck: And the Blink Tag! The goodies. So you got the he HTML book – and what website did you build that was your first big project?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3:07 – Ben: It was fiddling around, but it was fortune cookie universe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3:20 – Chuck: You will have to recreate it!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3:27 – Ben: I think this was 1993/1995 timeframe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3:40 – Chuck: Yep, me too same time frame. If you had something <i>move</i> on your website it was so cool. You went to building...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:02 – Ben: JavaScript was a roadblock for me. There was nobody to correct me. I had a JavaScript book and it was a massive failure. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:33 – Chuck: You took a break and you came back?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:40 – Ben: Oh – people will PAY you to do this?!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:54 – Chuck: Did you go to college?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:01 – Ben: Yes, I have a Master’s in a different field. I was always a tech junkie. I just wanted to put things together. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:20 – Chuck: Take us through your journey through JS?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:30 – Ben: I started off with the jQuery piece of it. I needed Java, and it took me awhile to wrap my head around it at first. Through the trial and process of trying to get into Angular and React, too.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">6:19 – Chuck: Did you play with Backbone, Knockout, or Ember?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">6:32 – Ben: I did do SOME Ember and some Knockout. Those were my first interactions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">6:49 – Chuck: What got you into the profession? How did you get from your Master’s to being a tech guy?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">7:14 – Ben: From the Master’s field I learned a lot about human experience, and anted to breed the two together. Also, consulting and helping to build things, too.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">7:44 – Charles: What was the career change like?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">7:53 – Ben: I went to the federal government at first around the recession – it was good having a stable job. I was bored, though. While I was working for the government I was trying to get my foot in the door. From there I have been building my way up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">8:30 – Ben: I was working on Medicare.gov and then later...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">8:46 – Charles: We won’t use the word “disaster”!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What is it like to work for the government?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">9:20 – Ben: Yep. The federal government is a different area because they are stake holders. They were about WHO owned the content, and who do we have to talk to get something approved. It was not product oriented like a business. I made my transition to Politico, because I wanted to find solutions and diversify the problems I was having.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:31 – Chuck: Have you been there from the beginning?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:39 – Ben answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ben: They were looking for frontend developers</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:54 – Chuck: You are the lead there now. What was that like with the transition?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">11:08 – Ben talks about the beginnings stages of his time with Politico and the current situation. He talks about the different problems, challenges, and etc.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">11:36 – Chuck: Do you consider yourself a news organization or?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">11:47 – Ben: We have Politico Pro, too. I have been working with this site more so. There are updates about campaign and voting data. People will pay a fee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">12:25 – Chuck: Do they pain themselves as leaning one way or another or nonpartisan?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">12:38 – Ben: We are objective and nonpartisan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">12:51 – Chuck: I know, I was hesitant to ask. What’s the mission of the company and into what you do?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">13:09 – Ben: The projects get dumped to us and we are about solving the problems. What is the best route for solving it? I had to help pioneer the new framework into the tech staff is one of my roles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">13:48 – Chuck: What’s your tech stack?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">13:55 – Ben: JavaScript and <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s5">Vue.js.</span></a> We are experimenting with other software, too. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">14:16 – Chuck: We should get you talking about <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s5">Vue</span></a> on the other show!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Are you working at home?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">14:32 – Ben answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ben: One thing I am helping with Meetup. Community outreach is important and I’m apart of that. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">15:09 – Chuck: Yep, it’s interesting to see various fields into the tech world. I am not one of those liberal arts majors, I do have a computer science degree. It’s interesting to see the different perspectives. How little it is for someone to be able to dive-in right away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What are you working on?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:09 – Ben: <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s5">Meetup</span></a> population and helping with the work at <a href="https://www.politico.com"><span class="s5">Politico.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:27 – Chuck: Reusable components. Are those opensource or only internal?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">16:41 – Ben: They are now opensource but we are seeing which portions can be opensource or not.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">17:01 – Chuck: Different companies have come out and offered their opensource. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">18:18 – Chuck: I have been writing a book on HOW to get a job as a coder. That’s the same advice that I am giving, too.</span></p>
