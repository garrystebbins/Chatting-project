0:55 – Chuck: Welcome to My Java Script story! You are the 4<sup>th</sup> person I have talk to today. I have only talked to one person in the U.S. Other people were from Denmark, Tennessee (USA), and Bulgaria.

1:39 – Guest: I am in Australia!

1:48 – Chuck: I try to open it up for different times and different locations. I started making my own program. I want one tool to manage my podcast company.

2:20 – Guest.

2:26 – Chuck: Introduce yourself, please!

2:33 – Guest: I have been working in JavaScript for 2 years now, and I just FOUND it. I could have been put anywhere but working with a large company. I discovered React.js. I went to study Math and Chemistry originally.

3:24 – Chuck: What was it – why did you change from mathematics to programming?

3:38 – Guest: I like solving problems and that has been true my whole life.

4:25 – Chuck: I identify with that – you’re right – for me, it’s more tangible and it’s neat to see something being built.

White line on a black floor is mentioned.

5:30 – Guest: I had a great education, but seems like the education in the U.S. is more fun. We didn’t get to program and stuff like that.

5:51 – Chuck: My experience was that I got to do really interesting things in High School.

6:20 – Guest: I think you reap benefits by diving into one topic.

6:36 – Chuck: We were building little circuits that were turning on/off LED. We then went to building robots and then computer chips. How did you get into JavaScript?

7:01 – Guest: We didn’t touch JavaScript until my 3<sup>rd</sup> year. I went to a school in Jerusalem for a while.

9:05 – Chuck: How did you get your first programming job?

9:10 – Guest: I wasn’t really applying – I thought I would travel for a year or so. It was weird I didn’t think I had to apply to jobs right away. I applied to a few jobs, and my friend started sharing my resume around and I ended up doing some contract work for that company. I used RUBY for that team.

10:18 – Chuck: First few jobs I got were through the “spray-and-pray” method. The best jobs I got are because I KNEW somebody.

10:30 – _Guest and Chuck go back-and-forth._

11:31 – _Guest mentions networking._

11:41 – Chuck: What have you done with JavaScript that you are especially proud of?

11:45 – Guest.

13:43 – Chuck: I didn’t know that honestly. I never really thought of integrating React Native into a native app.

14:00 – Guest: Yeah, it’s really cool. I didn’t think about it before either!

14:24 – Chuck: What are you working on now?

14:28 – Guest: Actually, I am working on some integration with different parties. Now we are routing everything back to the backend.

15:46 – Chuck: I think I have heard of Pro...

15:52 – Guest: Yeah, they are located in the U.S.

16:01 – Chuck: Every community/country is different, but what is it like to be a programmer in Melbourne, Australia?

16:16 – Guest: It’s cool and I think it has a way to go. We have a React Meetup.

16:55 – Chuck: Sounds like you have a healthy community down there. So in Denmark if you get away from the bigger cities then you have a harder time finding a community in the rural areas.

17:30 – Guest: Do you spend more time online?

17:50 – Chuck: Yeah, I don’t know. I live in Utah. It is hard because there is a community North in Logan, UT.

18:13 – Guest: You have 5-6 main cities in Australia. We don’t have medium-sized cities. In the U.S. you have a mixture out there.

18:42 – Chuck talks about the population throughout Utah.

19:03 – _Guest asks a question to Chuck._

19:09 – Chuck: Yes, Facebook is putting in Data Center about 20 minutes away from my house. They have built satellite offices here. The startup scene is picking up, too.

19:49 – Chuck: We are fairly large land wise. We can spread-out more.

20:07 – Guest talks about the population density in Australia vs. U.S.

20:20 – Chuck: It’s interesting to see what the differences are.

If you are in a community that HAS a tech community you are set.

20:39 – Guest: I find it really interesting.

21:25 – Guest: Humans are a funny species – you can put out your hand, shake it, and you start talking.

21:45 – _Chuck talks about the tech hubs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in U.S._

22:17 – Guest: Yeah, if you aren’t interested than you aren’t interested.

22:28 – Chuck.

22:37 – Guest.

22:53 – Chuck: Join the mailing list, get involved and there are online groups, too.

23:11 – Guest: I really didn’t get into functional programming at first. I got to talk about this at a React Meetup.

24:25 – Chuck: The logic is the same.

24:32 – Guest: You put these functions together and there you go!

24:40 – Chuck: Go ahead.

24:48 – _The guest is talking about React’s integrations._

24:56 – Chuck: Anything that is shared and put in some functional component, hook it up, and that’s it. Picks!

29:55 – Guest: Shout-out to my mentors. I am really blessed to have these mentors in my life and I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for them. Lucas is one of them who work with Prettier.
