This week, My Javascript Story welcomes Javan Makhmali, Programmer at Basecamp from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Javan attended Community College to study Computer Science but then decided to work as a Freelancer developer. Javan and Charles debate whether having a 4-year college degree is better to become a developer and conclude that it depends on the person. Some people prefer a structured 4 year degree to feel ready for a full time jo and some people do better with bootcamps. Javan mentions he knows several people that switched careers after  completing an 8 week bootcamp and that the industry was really flexible to accomodate both options.  

Charles and Javan then continue talking about Javan's journey as a developer and particularly his journey with Basecamp.
