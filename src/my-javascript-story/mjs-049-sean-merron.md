 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood **Guest:** Sean Merron This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Sean Merron. Sean is currently in Austin, Texas and is originally from Virginia Beach, Virginia. He is a full-time software engineer, and has been for a little over 15 years now, and runs a podcast called [2 Frugal Dudes](https://2frugaldudes.com/). He first got into programming when he was in high school and went to a trade school for computer networking. This trade school really gave him a leg up with his certifications and led him to his first job where he did tech support for an office. Sean urges new programmers to always have a project and to never be afraid to learn something new. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
