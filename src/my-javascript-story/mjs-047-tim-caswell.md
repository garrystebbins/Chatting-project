 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood **Guest:** Tim Caswell This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Tim Caswell. Tim got into programming when he was a kid and would mess around on a Commodore 64 he had found. He next moved onto writing games in Cue Basic, and once the internet came into play in the mid to late 90â€™s, his programming really took off, especially after he got Windows. Tim has since written his own language based on Lua, called Luvit, worked on browser-based IDE systems, like Cloud 9, and so much more. After working on many projects and programs over the years, he is now focusing on building his startup. His advice is to always balance your needs with what you can do and make sure that you are always moving forward. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
