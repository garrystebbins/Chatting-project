 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Jonathan Carter

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Jonathan Carter. Jonathan is a PM at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) and has been a web developer for over 15 years. At Microsoft, he’s had the opportunity to work on tooling, platform pieces for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) applications, and many other things. He first got into programming when his uncle let him shadow him and the IT department he had working for him, and this is where he was first introduced to software and the idea of working with computers as a career. They talk about his proudest accomplishments within the JavaScript community as well as what he is working on now.
