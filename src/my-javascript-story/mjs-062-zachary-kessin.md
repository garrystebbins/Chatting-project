 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Zachary Kessin

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Zachary Kessin. Zach is a web developer who has written [_Programming HTML5 Applications_](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-HTML5-Applications-Cross-Platform-Environments/dp/1449399088) and [_Building Web Applications with Erlang_](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Web-Applications-Erlang-Working/dp/1449309968). Currently, he works a lot with functional programming. He first got into programming because his mother used to write in [Lisp](http://lisp-lang.org/) and he earned his first computer by begging his relatives to help pitch in to get him one when he was seven. They talk about what led him to [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), why he wanted to be a programmer from a young age, and what he is most proud of in his career.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
