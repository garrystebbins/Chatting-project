 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Quincy Larson

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Quincy Larson. Quincy created [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), whose goal is to build a huge community of people who will then contribute to the project so that they can help more people learn code for free. Quincy first got into programming when he wanted to find a way to get teachers out from behind the computer and into the classrooms. This revealed to him how powerful technology was and really got him interested in learning more code. He feels very strongly about the importance of accessibility and strived to make his camp as accessible as he could so he could reach the most people with it.&nbsp;
