**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Tracy Lee

This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Tracy Lee. Tracy is the co-founder [This Dot](https://www.thisdot.co/) and her goal with it is to bring the [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) community together. She first got into programming when she tried to build websites for people and then was interested in learning [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and really fell in love with the community. She really stayed with [Angular](https://angular.io/) because of the community she found there, the size of the community, and the fact that it gave her the ability to have a voice.
