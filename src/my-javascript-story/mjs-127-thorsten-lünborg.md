question1: How did you get introduced to JavaScript?
answer1: >-
  While learning Vue i also started learning JavaScript. I often go through
  times of intense learning where i decide on something in physics for example,
  and i watch off of YouTube videos about it and spend all my free time learning
  it. JavaScript was like that.

Thorsten is also a core team member for Vue.js and he talks about his involvement with the Vue community. Thorsten mainly focuses on working on Vue CLI and answering questions in forums. He describes the Vue community as a very friendly and helpful one. According to Thorsten, Vue is very stable and seems to satisfy a lot of the needs of Vue community and so people are not looking for the "next best thing" with Vue.
