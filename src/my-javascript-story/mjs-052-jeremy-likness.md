 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Jeremy Likness

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Jeremy Likness. Jeremy works for Microsoft currently and first got into programming when he was kept home while having a sunburn and taught himself how to type in a program into his family’s TI-99 4A computer and then later moved on to the Commodore 64. They stress the fact that you can be a successful programmer, no matter your background and they talk about the pros and cons of being a cloud developer advocate.
