## Episode Summary

Ryan grew up around technology as his parents were also software developers. He got his first computer at age 9 and spent his high school years playing with computers. However, he got discouraged when he did poorly in AP Computer Science Exam. He felt programming was an innate talent that he wasn't born with. At age 21, he re-started from the beginning by reading basic programing books and by trial and error he got better. Ryan and Charles both stress that you get better at software development by 'doing' and it is not a talent you are born with.
