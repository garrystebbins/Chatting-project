 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Scott Wyatt

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Scott Wyatt. Scott is a VC partner and is the CTO at [Cali Style Technologies](https://cali-style.com/), works with startups, and was the CTO of the [Dollar Beard Club](https://thebeardclub.com/). He first got into programming because his dad was a computer programmer and he really got hooked from a young age writing games and playing on the computer. They talk about the benefit of not living in the hustle and bustle of California and the Silicon Valley, how he got into [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), what was it about JavaScript that hooked him, and more!
