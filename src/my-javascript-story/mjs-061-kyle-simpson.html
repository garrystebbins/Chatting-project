<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Panel: </b>Charles Max Wood</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Guest:</b> Kyle Simpson</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Kyle Simpson. Kyle is most well-known for being the writer of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-Js-Book/dp/B01AY9P0P6"><span class="s2"><i>You Don’t Know JS</i></span></a>. He first got into programming because his friend’s dad was a programmer and he was hooked by the software side of computers. He grew up writing games with QBasic and Turbo Pascal and then in his teens did some client projects. He was very much a self-taught programmer and ended up sticking with it into his career today. They talk about what led him to JavaScript and what he is doing currently. </span></p>
