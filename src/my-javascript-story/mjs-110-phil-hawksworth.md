### **Episode Summary**
Currently the Head of Developer Relations at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), Phil has been a developer for 20 years. Even though he was interested in computers from an early age, he started&nbsp; studying Civil Engineering in university before changing course and switching to Computer Science. Though he didn't particularly enjoy studying Computer Science, he really liked working with HTML where he didn't have to compile any code and that's when he started thinking about a career in web development. Phil talks about his favorite projects he has worked on using [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and JavaScript. He works remotely out of London, UK and as head of developer relations he spends a lot of time traveling for conferences for work. He doesn't have a 'typical' work day, but when he is not traveling for work he enjoys catching up on conversations on Slack and Twitter about JAMstack and collaborating with the rest of is team in San Francisco.
