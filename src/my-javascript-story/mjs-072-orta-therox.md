**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Orta Therox

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Orta Therox. Orta is a native engineer that believes that the right way to build systems is to understand as many systems as possible. He works predominately on iOS programming at a company called [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/), where they make it easy to buy and sell art on the internet. He first got into programming because he loved playing video games as a child, loved creating his own video games, and worked his way up from there. They talk about his work at Artsy, how he used open source to learn himself how program, how he got into Ruby and then React and React Native, and more!
