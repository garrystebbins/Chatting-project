 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Fred Zirdung

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Fred Zirdung. Fred is currently the head of curriculum at [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/), where he essentially builds all of the tools and learning materials for the students there. He is also an instructor and has been there for five years. Prior to that, he worked for multiple companies such as [Walmart Labs](https://www.walmartlabs.com/) as well as many small startups. He first got into programming with the Logo programming language in the 6<sup>th</sup> grade and he had always been interested in working with computers since a young age. They talk about what got him into web programming, what enthralled him about [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/') and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and what he is proud of contributing to the JavaScript community.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
