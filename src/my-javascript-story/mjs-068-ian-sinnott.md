**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Ian Sinnott

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Ian Sinnott. Since being on JavaScript Jabber for [Episode 227](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/227-jsj-fostering-community-through-react-with-benjamin-dunphy-berkeley-martinez-and-ian-sinnott), he has being writing a lot in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and has been taking a break from the meetups and podcast scene. He first got into programming when he took two CS courses in college that focused on Java graphical programming and SML. Once these courses were through, he stopped programming for a while and came back to it when he was creating an HTML email template. They talk about why he was excited with web development, how he got into [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), what he is working on currently, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
