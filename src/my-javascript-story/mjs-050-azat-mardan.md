He also founded [Node University](https://node.university/), speaks at conferences, and works at [Capitol One](https://www.capitalone.com/). Azat first got into programming when he was in college and his major was Informatics in eastern Europe and then when he graduated, he taught himself JavaScript and PHP and did some freelance work. Once he came to the United States, he got his master’s degree in Information Systems Technology and was building websites for country embassies.
