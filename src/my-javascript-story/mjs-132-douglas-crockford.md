question1: 'How did Douglas Crockford get started with programming? '
answer1: >-
  In school i did general studies for first year and one of the requirements for
  that was for math. And one of the ways of satisfying that was Fortran. So I
  took a Fortran class. At that time it was punching cards and submitting them
  to the mainframe in the library. And I was really good at it. And I really
  enjoyed it. So I took the second class. And then the third class and then
  that's all there was. Because computer science didn't exist yet. At least not
  at that school so I self taught the rest of it. That's how I got into
  programming.
question2: Why did Douglas Crockford specialize in JavaScript?
answer2: ' I always tried to be a generalist I trained myself to be a generalist, but I''m best known as being a specialist in something that I would never picked. I never wanted to be the JavaScript guy right I ever had a campaign. This is how I can take over the JavaScript field, I can get in front of this thing. It was never liked that.'
question3: 'Who is Douglas Crockford ? '
answer3: >-
  Douglas Crockford is a language architect and helped with the development of
  JavaScript. He popularized the data format JSON, and has developed various
  JavaScript related tools such as JSLint and JSMin.

Douglas Crockford is a language architect and helped with the development of JavaScript. He popularized the data format JSON, and has developed various JavaScript related tools such as JSLint and JSMin. He started working with JavaScript in 2000. He talks about his journey with the language, including his initial confusion and struggles, which led him to write his book JavaScript: The Good Parts.

Douglas realized that there's going to be a convergence of TV and computing very early in his career. So a lot of his career has been bridging those two things, helping the evolution toward digital media. After working for Atari he went to work at Lucasfilm where he stayed for 8 years.
