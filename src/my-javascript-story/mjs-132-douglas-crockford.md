question1: 'How did you get started with programming? '
answer1: >-
  In school i did general studies for first year and one of the requirements for
  that was for math. And one of the ways of satisfying that was Fortran. So I
  took a Fortran class. At that time it was punching cards and submitting them
  to the mainframe in the library. And I was really good at it. And I really
  enjoyed it. So I took the second class. And then the third class and then
  that's all there was.
