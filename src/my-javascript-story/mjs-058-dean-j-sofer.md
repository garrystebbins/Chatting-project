 **Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Dean J Sofer

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Dean J Sofer. Dean currently works at PlayStation now and has recently taken a step back from open source recently. He first got into programming because his Dad was really into technology, and he first started off with scripting and creating portfolio websites. They also talk about his time using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and what he is working on now.
