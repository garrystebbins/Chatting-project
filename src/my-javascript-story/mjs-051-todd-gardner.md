**Panel:** Charles Max Wood **Guest:** Todd Gardner This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Todd Gardner. Todd is one of the co-founders of [Track JS](https://trackjs.com/), which is a JavaScript error monitoring service. He first got into programming in Jr. High when he and his friends played around with computers they had dumpster dived for from their school in order to play video games. In High School, he learned how to create websites so that people could register for his LAN parties online. They also discuss the importance of finding passion in what you do as well as what Todd is most proud of contributing to the JS community. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
