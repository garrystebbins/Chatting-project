**Panel:** Charles Max Wood

**Guest:** Kevin Griffin

This week on My JavaScript Story, Charles speaks with Kevin Griffin. Kevin is one of the hosts of the [2 Frugal Dudes Podcast](https://2frugaldudes.com/) which helps programmers learn how to be smarter with handling their money. He first got into programming really young when his Dad brought home a computer and he was curious about it so he read books and taught himself basic programming that way. They talk about his first job out of college and how that has impacted him now, the fact that you have to create your own job security, and what kind of frameworks he uses. They also touch on the importance of exposing yourself to new technologies and being open-minded, what he is working on currently, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
