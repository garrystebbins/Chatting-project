<p class="p6"><span class="s3">0:55 – Chuck: Welcome to My Java Script story! You are the 4</span><span class="s6"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s3"> person I have talk to today. I have only talked to one person in the U.S. Other people were from Denmark, Tennessee (USA), and Bulgaria. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:39 – Guest: I am in Australia!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:48 – Chuck: I try to open it up for different times and different locations. I started making my own program. I want one tool to manage my podcast company. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:20 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:26 – Chuck: Introduce yourself, please!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:33 – Guest: I have been working in JavaScript for 2 years now, and I just FOUND it. I could have been put anywhere but working with a large company. I discovered React.js. I went to study Math and Chemistry originally. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">3:24 – Chuck: What was it – why did you change from mathematics to programming?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">3:38 – Guest: I like solving problems and that has been true my whole life. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">4:25 – Chuck: I identify with that – you’re right – for me, it’s more tangible and it’s neat to see something being built. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">White line on a black floor is mentioned. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">5:30 – Guest: I had a great education, but seems like the education in the U.S. is more fun. We didn’t get to program and stuff like that. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">5:51 – Chuck: My experience was that I got to do really interesting things in High School. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:20 – Guest: I think you reap benefits by diving into one topic. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:36 – Chuck: We were building little circuits that were turning on/off LED. We then went to building robots and then computer chips. How did you get into JavaScript? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:01 – Guest: We didn’t touch JavaScript until my 3</span><span class="s6"><sup>rd</sup></span><span class="s3"> year. I went to a school in Jerusalem for a while. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:05 – Chuck: How did you get your first programming job?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:10 – Guest: I wasn’t really applying – I thought I would travel for a year or so. It was weird I didn’t think I had to apply to jobs right away. I applied to a few jobs, and my friend started sharing my resume around and I ended up doing some contract work for that company. I used RUBY for that team. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">10:18 – Chuck: First few jobs I got were through the “spray-and-pray” method. The best jobs I got are because I KNEW somebody. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">10:30 – <i>Guest and Chuck go back-and-forth.</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">11:31 – <i>Guest mentions networking.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">11:41 – Chuck: What have you done with JavaScript that you are especially proud of?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">11:45 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">13:43 – Chuck: I didn’t know that honestly. I never really thought of integrating React Native into a native app. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">14:00 – Guest: Yeah, it’s really cool. I didn’t think about it before either! </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">14:24 – Chuck: What are you working on now? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">14:28 – Guest: Actually, I am working on some integration with different parties. Now we are routing everything back to the backend. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:46 – Chuck: I think I have heard of Pro...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:52 – Guest: Yeah, they are located in the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">16:01 – Chuck: Every community/country is different, but what is it like to be a programmer in Melbourne, Australia? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">16:16 – Guest: It’s cool and I think it has a way to go. We have a React Meetup. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">16:55 – Chuck: Sounds like you have a healthy community down there. So in Denmark if you get away from the bigger cities then you have a harder time finding a community in the rural areas. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">17:30 – Guest: Do you spend more time online?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">17:50 – Chuck: Yeah, I don’t know. I live in Utah. It is hard because there is a community North in Logan, UT. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">18:13 – Guest: You have 5-6 main cities in Australia. We don’t have medium-sized cities. In the U.S. you have a mixture out there. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">18:42 – Chuck talks about the population throughout Utah. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">19:03 – <i>Guest asks a question to Chuck.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">19:09 – Chuck: Yes, Facebook is putting in Data Center about 20 minutes away from my house. They have built satellite offices here. The startup scene is picking up, too.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">19:49 – Chuck: We are fairly large land wise. We can spread-out more.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:07 – Guest talks about the population density in Australia vs. U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:20 – Chuck: It’s interesting to see what the differences are. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">If you are in a community that HAS a tech community you are set.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:39 – Guest: I find it really interesting. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">21:25 – Guest: Humans are a funny species – you can put out your hand, shake it, and you start talking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">21:45 – <i>Chuck talks about the tech hubs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in U.S.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:17 – Guest: Yeah, if you aren’t interested than you aren’t interested.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:28 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:37 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:53 – Chuck: Join the mailing list, get involved and there are online groups, too. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">23:11 – Guest: I really didn’t get into functional programming at first. I got to talk about this at a React Meetup. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">24:25 – Chuck: The logic is the same. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">24:32 – Guest: You put these functions together and there you go!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">24:40 – Chuck: Go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">24:48 – <i>The guest is talking about React’s integrations. </i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">24:56 – Chuck: Anything that is shared and put in some functional component, hook it up, and that’s it. Picks!</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s3">29:55 – Guest: Shout-out to my mentors. I am really blessed to have these mentors in my life and I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for them. Lucas is one of them who work with Prettier. </span></p>
