## Panel

* Richard Littauer
* Jon Schlinkert 
* Eric Berry

## Episode Summary

The panel discusses the announcement of the beta [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors), a new way to financially support the developers who build the open source software. They list the features they like that GitHub Sponsors offers but think the beta roll-out could have been handled differently. A lot of critical software is dependent on Open Source libraries that are maintained by not supported and burned-out developers. One of the examples the panel uses is border patrolling drones that are used to identify threats that use these Open Source libraries can suffer if Open Source Sponsorship is geared only towards finished products and not libraries like these.
