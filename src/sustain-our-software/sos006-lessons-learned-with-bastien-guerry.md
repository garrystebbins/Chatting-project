**Joined By Special Guest:** Bastien Guerry

## Episode Summary

Bastien Guerry is employed by the French Administration in a program named [Entrepreneurs d'intérêt général](https://twitter.com/eigforever) inspired by [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/).  He is also the Release Manager of [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/), an information management and outlining tool for Emacs.

 Bastien wrote his first software for his girlfriend to help her with her thesis. He then went onto maintan Org Mode between 2011-1015. Bastien resembles open source software maintainers' job to that of stay-at-home mothers' job description, as both are a lot of work and involve a lot of responsibility and stress and  both are not compensated financially. 

The panel then ask about the evolution of [Fund The Code Project](https://www.fundthecode.org/) which supports the free software movement by donations from sponsors. Bastien invites free software maintainers to [contact](contact@fundthecode.org) [Fund The Code Project](https://www.fundthecode.org/) for help in finding sponsors.
