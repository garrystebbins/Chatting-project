question1: What do you get when using Gatsby?
answer1: >-

  having the JavaScript running to preload website URL’s when you hover over
  them
question2: What is a Gatsby theme?
answer2: NPM installable subsets of your Gatsby site.
question3: How are Gatsby themes more powerful than other CSS themes?

  Gatsby themes are more powerful because of the way you can both horizontally

answer4: >-
  A Gatsby specific CMS, themes that can be pulled from a variety of sources,
  the ecosystem will open up in terms of people who can use it. Chris also
