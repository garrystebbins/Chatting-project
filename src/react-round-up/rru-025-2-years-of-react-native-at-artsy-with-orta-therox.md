**Special Guests:** Orta Therox

In this episode, the React Round Up panelists talk to Orta Therox about his 2 years of experience with React Native at [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/). Orta has about 15 years of native Mac and iOS development experience and about 2 ½ years ago, his team decided to start writing their iOS app in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
