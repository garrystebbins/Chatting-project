 **Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Tara Manicsic
- Kent C Dodds

**Special Guests:** Henrik Joreteg

In this episode of React Round Up, the panel discusses redux-bundler with Henrik Joreteg. Henrik spoke at the first Node Conf, leans towards progressive web apps and single-page apps, and recently has gotten into independent consulting. He also has written a book called [_Human JavaScript_](http://humanjavascript.com/) and is working on his second book right now. They talk about his [redux-bundler](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/redux-bundler) on GitHub and the ability to make changes behind the scenes without having to bother the user. He gives a general background on why he created the bundler and how you can use it in your programming to make your life easier.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Henrik introduction
- What is the [redux-bundler](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/redux-bundler)?
- He despises using behavioral components
- If it can be local, keep it local
- Don’t bother the user if you don’t need to 
- Service Workers vs redux-bundler
- Making changes behind the scenes
- He loves to build apps
- Can you see any case where it would be useful to have a Service Worker in the background?
- [Redux-bundler example](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/redux-bundler-example)
- [Redux-bundler worker example](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/redux-bundler-worker-example)
- What are the pros and cons to using the redux-bundler?
- At what point do you need [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)?
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- How did you get to the point to where you decided to make this bundler?
- Uses React as a glorified templating language
- He gets nervous when people start writing a lot of application code
- [Speedy.gift](https://speedy.gift/)
- Easier to use this from the beginning 
- This bundler is used to show patterns
- And much, much more!
