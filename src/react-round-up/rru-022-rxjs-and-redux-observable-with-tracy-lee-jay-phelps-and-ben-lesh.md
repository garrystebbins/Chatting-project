**Panel:**

- Nader Dabit
- Sia Karamalegos
  **Special Guests:** Tracy Lee, Jay Phelps, and Ben Lesh

In this episode, the React Round Up panelists talk to Tracy Lee, Jay Phelps, and Ben Lesh about RxJS and redux-observable. Tracy, Jay, and Ben are the RxJS [ThisDot](https://www.thisdot.co/) Media group and where they do support contracts for [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/), staff augmentation, developer relations, and put on events. They talk about what observables are and what they are trying to solve, the most common use cases for getting started with observables, and what Promises and Async/Await are. They also touch on what they like most about RxJS, how versatile it is, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
