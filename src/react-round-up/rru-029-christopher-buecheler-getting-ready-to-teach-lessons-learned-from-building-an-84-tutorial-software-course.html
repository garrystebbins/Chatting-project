<p class="p2"><span class="s4"><b>Special Guests:</b></span><span class="s5"> <a href="http://cwbuecheler.com"><span class="s2">Christopher Buecheler</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks with <a href="http://cwbuecheler.com"><span class="s2">Christopher Buecheler</span></a> who is a web developer and moved into JavaScript in 2000. Christopher runs his own business, and records and edits videos among many other responsibilities. He also has a lot of hobbies, and guitars are one of them. Check out today’s episode where the panel and Christopher talk about how to form a tutorial course from start to finish. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:38 – Chuck: I always am fascinated by how there are a lot of programmers who are musicians.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:00 – Panelist: Yes, I agree. Coding takes creativity. People who are programmers are surprisingly into different arts where it asks for the person’s creativity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:17 – Panelist: Video games, music, cocktails, etc. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:05 – Guest: Yes, for a while I liked to make beer. My current kitchen doesn’t allow for it now, though. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:25 – Chuck: So your 84/86 tutorial course...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:46 – Guest: I liked to be one or two weeks ahead. Now building the entire app, instead of doing it week-to-week.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:35 – Chuck: What is the process like – building these videos?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:51 – Guest: I try to focus on MVP products that are super easy, and that aren’t too complicated. For example, Music List. Add albums and artists, and see other people’s lists. It ended up being a long tutorial. The process: I build the app, rebuild the app from scratch, I start with a script, read the pretty version and have the marked-down one for my use. The script goes up as the text tutorial. Do my video editing in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Onk6_vH3QIVBgppCh1aAwEVEAAYASAAEgIu8vD_BwE&amp;sdid=KKQOM&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!247425965201!e!!g!!adobe%2520premier&amp;ef_id=W6K5tAAAAKzsP-f1:20180919210348:s"><span class="s2">Adobe Premiere</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:55 – Question from panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:52 – Panelist: I have found that extremely hard to do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:29 – Chuck talks about his process of recording his tutorials. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck: I don’t have a script; I just walk through it as I am going along. You can get it transcribed, which I have done in the past. I have a license for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_Onk6_vH3QIVBgppCh1aAwEVEAAYASAAEgIu8vD_BwE&amp;sdid=KKQOM&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!247425965201!e!!g!!adobe%2520premier&amp;ef_id=W6K5tAAAAKzsP-f1:20180919210348:s"><span class="s2">Adobe Premiere</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:04 – Panelist: I never recorded a tutorial before but I have written a lot of blog posts. I reviewed it, and reviewing it is a very interesting take. I learn a lot in the process. The things cement in my mind while reviewing. Videos you have the real-time thing going on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:00 – Guest adds additional comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:39 – Chuck chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck: We really appreciate you leaving the mistakes in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:11 – Guest: Yes, they watch you debug. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:20 – Panelist: Most of your tutorials are beginner focused, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:23 – Guest: Yes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Christopher goes into detail here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:13 – Chuck chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck: My thought is to learn x, y, z in 1 hour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:35 – Guest: People are attracted to shorter tutorials. 5-minute React. Don’t build an 84 tutorial course. They are built up to digestible chunks. It’s not wall-to-wall coding, because that would seem overwhelming to me. Let’s learn something in a bite-size chunk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:41 – Panelist: <a href="https://egghead.io"><span class="s2">Egghead.</span></a> Because of their guidelines they do good work. 1-5 minutes long tutorials. You can get a good run-down and a good introduction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:24 – Panelist: You can find it really easy. You don’t need a 1-hour video.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:40 – Chuck: Yeah, to break it up in small sections. People will see this in my e-book course. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:02 – Panelist: Do people give you a lot of feedback? What parts of this React course do people have most difficulty with?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:21 – Guest: It’s not React based, it’s actually other issues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">210:6 – Guest: <a href="https://redux.js.org"><span class="s2">Redux</span></a></span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:53 – Guest: What’s the best way to use props? Where should I put my Logic versus...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:15 – Panelist: This is very similar when I teach...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:46 – Guest: I have seen people say that if you truly see how this works in JavaScript then you really understand how JavaScript works. React can be confusing if you are using class-based components. You have to use binder or error functions, etc. It becomes confusing at times. Another area you mentioned was state: component state or your application state. Two different things, but they interact with each other. Understanding the difference between the two. Should I store it in this store or...? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">24:09 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com"><span class="s2">Digital Ocean Advertisement.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:47 – Panelist: Were you doing this as a side thing? How do you keep up in the industry if you aren’t making “real” projects?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:25 – Guest gives his answer plus his background with companies, clients, and programs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Guest: I really wanted to build my own company, when I was thinking of ideas I came across some great brainstorming ideas. I have a lot of traffic coming to these tutorials. I really liked giving something back to the web development community. I liked interacting with people and getting them to their “Ah Ha!” moment. It’s able to support me and helps me moving forward. I follow a ton of people on Twitter – the React team. I pay a ton of attention to what people are looking to learn. I play around those things for my own edification. I pick up some contract work and it helps me to stay current. It’s always a culmination for things. Part of the job is not to fall behind. If you are creating tutorials you have to reteach yourself things as things changes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:46 – Panelist asks another question. How do you get new leads and new customers?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:02 – Guest answers questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Guest: I was on a mentality if “I build it they will come.” This isn’t the best mentality. That was not a good approach. I started working with a consultant: how do we get this out to people? No ads, no subscription service. My e-mail list. I have gone from 1,600 to 4,600 people on my email list. Find the people who are interested.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:52 – Guest: Find your voice, and how you choose to deliver your information. Text? Video? Or both? What do you want to teach? Don’t teach what you think will sell the most. It’s more important to be excited an interested what you are teaching. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:05 – Panelist: When I am teaching something I try to remember of the feeling when I was learning it. For example, Harrison Ford. What was I thinking? How did I learn this concept?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:01 – Guest: When I learned React it was because a client asked me to learn it. 4-6 weeks of exhausting terror and me trying to learn this to make useful code for this client. In about that time (4-6 weeks) “Oh I understand what I am doing now!” We are still on good terms today with this said client. When I am trying to learn something, the next level is here is a blog, and comments. There aren’t a lot of intermediary steps. They explain every kind of step. I took a similar approach with my other course. That’s informed by my own experience when learning these different technologies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:08 – Guest: Yes – check out my newsletter, and my new resource every week. Follow me at Twitter or my personal Twitter where I talk about the NBA too much. Email me if you have any questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:11 – Chuck: Anything else? Okay, picks!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">38:24 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s2">Chuck’s Advertisement for His Course!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:01 – Picks!</span></p>
