**Special Guest:** Ajay NS
### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of React Round Up, the panel talks with Ajay NS, a Computer Engineering student at National Institute of Technology Surat who is passionate about frontend development and design. Ajay talks about his article [Why you should use GatsbyJS to build static&nbsp;sites](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-should-use-gatsbyjs-to-build-static-sites-4f90eb6d1a7b) on Medium and why he felt the need to write it. After attending the Plone Conference in Tokyo where he gave a talk about GatsbyJS, he realized that compared to React or Angular, Gatsby helped new developers learn about frontend development without facing too many complications. Ajay explains that he decided to write the article and share his experiences with Gatsby to help ease the learning process for new developers who are curious about frontend development. They discuss best cases to use Gatsby for and also cases where it may not be a good idea to use it. They then discuss the best tools for people who are new to web development and are trying to find jobs as remote developers. One of the best methods recommended is pair programming which can also be done remotely.
