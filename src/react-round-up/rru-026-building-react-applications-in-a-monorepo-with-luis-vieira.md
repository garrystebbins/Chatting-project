**Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Luis Vieira

In this episode, the React Round Up panelists talk to Luis Vieira about his [“Building large scale react applications in a monorepo”](https://medium.com/@luisvieira_gmr/building-large-scale-react-applications-in-a-monorepo-91cd4637c131). Luis works in Portugal at a company called [FarFetch](https://www.farfetch.com/) as a front-end architect where he works mostly on [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and infrastructure. They talk about the rationale behind his article, shared components, and what [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is and what is does. They also touch on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), the difference between monolithic application and a monorepo, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
