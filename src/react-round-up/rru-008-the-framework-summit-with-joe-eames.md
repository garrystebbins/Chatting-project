 **Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Joe Eames

In this episode of React Round Up, the panel discusses [The Framework Summit](https://www.frameworksummit.com/) with Joe Eames. Joe discusses the history behind the conference and how it came to be created. They really wanted to create a conference that would include all of the frameworks, especially those that are underrepresented in the programming community, like [React](https://reactjs.org/). He touches on why he is passionate about this project, why it is important to be open to learning new things, and the overall format of the conference.
