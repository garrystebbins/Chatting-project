### **Episode Summary**
On today’s show the panel discusses what what jobs should be delegated to the front and backend when doing fullstack development with React. They talk about where the data fetching starts coming into play in a react app and the big changes from the old web to the modern web in data fetching. They discuss how much interaction with the backend there is when working with front end applications, but also the importance of properly separating backend and frontend teams.They discuss the pros and cons of separating the front and backend teams, and agree that the problem space between both back and frontend is the user interface. They talk about where middlewares fit in. The panel notes that it is important to ensure that your new app can still communicate with older versions, and talk about different ways of dealing with it, such as continually evolving schema, installing new versions, or even never deleting anything and only adding new events. The panel talks about who should work the middle layer and who, between frontend and backend developers, should be put in charge of maintaining it. They discuss the misconception that using React makes server-side jobs irrelevant and how React actually helps. They note how automation in programming has changed the way that people use the web. They conclude by saying it is important to understand there are different ways to do these kinds of things, and encouraging listeners to look at the abstractions being built out in the serverless world **Links**
