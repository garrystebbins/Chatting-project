 **Panel:**

**Special Guests** : Lucas Reis

In this episode of React Round Up, the panel discusses simple React patterns with Lucas Reis. Lucas works as a senior front-end developer at [Zocdoc](https://www.zocdoc.com/) and previously worked in Brazil for an ecommerce company called [B2W](https://ri.b2w.digital/). He recently wrote a [blog post](https://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/simple-react-patterns/) about simple React patterns that really took off and became popular on the web. They talk about this blog post, what defines a successful pattern, and then they discuss the different patterns that he has discovered in his years of [React](https://reactjs.org/) programming.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Lucas intro
