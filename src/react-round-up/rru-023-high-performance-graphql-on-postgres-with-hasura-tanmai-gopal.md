**Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Tanmai Gopal

In this episode, the React Round Up panelists talk to Tanmai Gopal. Tanmai is the founder at [Hasura](https://hasura.io/), where they have been building a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) tooling that helps accelerate being able to use GraphQL for app developers. They talk about what Hasura is and what inspired him to build it, what [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) does to [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), and query variables in GraphQL. They also touch on the importance of being aware of the database, how authorization works, and more!
