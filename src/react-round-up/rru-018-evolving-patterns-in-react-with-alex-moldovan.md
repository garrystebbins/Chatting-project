**Panel:**

**Special Guests** : Alex Moldovan

In this episode of React Round Up, the panel discusses the article [_Evolving Patterns in React_](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/evolving-patterns-in-react-116140e5fe8f) with its author, Alex Moldovan. Alex is from Romania and works at [Fortech](https://www.fortech.ro/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgL-12PSD3AIVhSJpCh3OHAXcEAAYASAAEgLC_fD_BwE) as an engineering manager where he works mostly with the front-end development. He also is one of the co-founders of [JSHeroes](https://jsheroes.io/), which is the biggest [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) conference in Romania that also has a growing international community behind it. They answer some of Charles questions about [React](https://reactjs.org/), talk about his article, their thoughts on the new changes, and more!
