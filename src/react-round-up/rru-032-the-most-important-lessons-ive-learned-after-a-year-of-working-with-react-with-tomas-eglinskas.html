<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:18 – Chuck: Our special guest is Tomas Eglinskas. We want to talk to you about your article you wrote on the <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org"><span class="s3">Free Code Camp Medium</span></a>. How do you get something posted/published there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:29 – Tomas – It’s not that hard to get something published there. You can send your articles via email and they will publish it. You can get feedback and resend it, and perhaps they will publish it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:06 – Chuck: Quincy and you are besties, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:11 – Chuck: We should get Quincy on this show. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:21 – Chuck: How did you get into <a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s3">React</span></a>? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:25 – Tomas: How I got into React is a bit interesting. It started at the university; at first it was really, really hard for me. Time pressed on and I got hooked. It’s really, really fun. That’s how it initially started.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">3:06 – Chuck: Article is titled: <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/mindset-lessons-from-a-year-with-react-1de862421981"><span class="s3">“The Most Important Lessons I’ve Learned After a Year of Working with React.”</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">3:18 – Tomas: What started behind it: I was doing my bucket list. I wanted to publish something at some point. I wanted to try to write and share something from my side of things. I wanted to prove to myself that I can/could. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">4:05 – Nader: What do you do now with <a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s3">React</span></a>? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">4:13 – Tomas: We do everything: frontend and backend. In my company we usually use everything with React with production and with my own projects. I have tried <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s3">Angular</span></a> but I like React best. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">4:45 – Chuck: I am curious...How do you get past that? Where my way is the right way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">5:10 – Thomas: That sentence came from when I was learning it. People would say: this is the way, or someone else would say: no, this is the way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">People are afraid of doing their own projects and using the technology. Finding information and figure out what is right and what is wrong, but you eventually figure out your own opinion. There are so many opinions and tutorials and it’s frustrating, because there are too many things to learn. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">6:26 – Chuck: Nader, what is the right way to do it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">6:33 – Nader: Yeah, I agree. It’s hard to decipher. What is right or what is wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">How did you come to your conclusions?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">My best practices might not be the best practices for someone else.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">7:18 – Tomas: Everyone is learning all the time. Their experiences are different. You have to decide what is best for the long-term. At least for me, it was practice and learning and reading from other people; from podcasts, articles, etc. I am open to say that I am not right, but want to know why it’s not “right.” Always trying, always making mistakes. I guess something like that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">8:42 – Nader: Don’t stick to the basics and become advanced. In any career right now you don’t know how to do everything, but to do one thing (topic) really well. The generalists aren’t the people they are hiring; they are hiring the specialists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">9:24 – Tomas comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">9:37 – Chuck: There is something to be said – I think it’s good to know general things, but you are right. They are hiring the specialists. They are going to look at you differently than other people. You like your thinking challenged a bit. Where do you go to do that to upgrade your skills?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">10:18 – Tomas: The silliest one is going to interiors. That’s the fastest way of feedback: what is right or wrong about my code. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Going to conferences and <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetups,</span></a> and doing projects with someone else. I was doing a project with a friend – everybody used Java – but we all used it differently. We all worked together and challenged each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">11:43 – Chuck: Talking to people – asking them: how do you do this, or why do you do it this way?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">12:01 – Tomas: Don’t be shy and have a presence. I guess in America there are a lot of <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetups,</span></a> in my country we don’t. In the States you have the people who do the tutorials, and such. You can be challenged everyday.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">12:40 – Chuck: It depends on where you are. Utah we have a strong community. It’s interesting to say. There was a talk given my Miles Forest at a conference. He would drive to Seattle to be apart of a users group to be apart of it – he would drive 2-3 hours to do this. Eventually, he made his own user group. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">13:55 – Nader: I am here in Europe now. I have seen a lot of events going on. Just all of the countries I have heard of different events. I haven’t heard about Lithuania, where you are at Tomas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">14:28 – Chuck: Get A Coder Job. Find <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetups</span></a> – I will tell people to do this. They will say: There aren’t any in my area. I tell them to type in different search words. To me, it’s telling because it’s “just TRY it!” You never know what will be out there. Go look and see if there is something out there for you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">15:28 – Nader: I agree. I learned a lot through those. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">15:59 – Tomas: It is a dream to be an organizer of event but people are afraid that nobody will show. Nobody expected for people to show-up, but they did! Don’t be afraid – you’ll have a great time!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">16:44 – Chuck: React is revolving so you need to be up-to-date – good point in your article. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">People want to reach some level of proficiency. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">You have to keep learning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">How do you stay up-to-date with all of the new features? How do you know what to look at?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">17:58 – Tomas: Don’t forget fundamentals. Now understand React from under the hood. You must know the reason behind it. I think that is the basic thing and the most important one, at least in my opinion. We get so wrapped up with the new things, but forgot the basics. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">18:41 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s3">Advertisement – Digital Ocean</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">19:27 – Nader: I am always checking Twitter. This is a good place to start, because I will see something being discussed and then maybe a year later how it all comes together. Twitter is real time. I follow the few top dozen important people through Twitter; Facebook people and other important people. They will talk about what is happening NOW and proposed things. Also, following people through Medium as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s3">GitHub.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">21:01 – Tomas: I agree about Twitter. It’s fun to see what people are talking about. Things that you normally don’t hear through normal avenues. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">21:27 – Nader: What interests you for the future? What do you want to specialize in? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">21:41 – Tomas: As I progress, and I know more things (than I did before) I find that I want to KNOW more, in general! I am focused on React and try new things. I think about DevOps, but it’s important to know at some level different things as a whole: the backend and the frontend, too. Why is DevOps is important in the first place. I like to understand the system as a whole. And little by little I want to specialize in the frontend, too. It’s good to know the whole infrastructure, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">23:23 – Nader comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">22:45 – Tomas comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">23:55 – Nader and Tomas go back-and-forth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">25:15 – Tomas: How big is your workshop?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">25:24 – Nader: We just did one in Croatia. It depends really 2 days, etc. Different lengths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">25:47 – Chuck: Nader, how do people find these different workshops? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">25:54 – Nader: <a href="https://twitter.com/dabit3"><span class="s3">Just follow me through Twitter!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">26:11 – Tomas: I would like to attend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">26:19 – Chuck: What was one of these lessons that were the hardest for you to learn?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">26:33 – Tomas: Not sticking to the basics. When you can show things that are more advanced. When you push yourself to know advanced topics then you are pushing those around you, too. You are encouraging others to learn, too! So that way both, you and the other people, aren’t stagnant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">27:51 – Chuck comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">28:00 – Tomas: It’s not even “fancy” it’s knowing the basics. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Tomas was talking about tutorials and other topics. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">30:02 – Nader and Tomas go back-and-forth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">30:24 – Chuck: I think it’s telling and what you are pointing out in your article. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Some people get to a level of proficiency, get the job, and then they go home, and that’s it. They aren’t pushing themselves. I’m not knocking these people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">But there are people out there saying: Here is what I learned, this is what I want to share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">31:29 – Tomas: Yes, share your knowledge!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">31:43 – Chuck: Other thing I want to talk about is another point in your article. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">32:07 – Tomas: You will look at your code a few days/weeks later and you will say: Wow, I can do this better. Don’t bash yourself; learn from it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">The most interesting screw-up was when I deleted a GitHub...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">33:43 – Chuck: What is your good / bad story, Nader?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">33:55 – Nader: My first job and have written the most terrible code. Go back a week / month later and notice major issues. The first year writing React was rough / interesting times. I learned a lot, because you are learning how the different architectural things work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">34:48 – Tomas: What was the hardest thing to learn?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">34:56 – Nader: Something being “buggy” and over-complex. It wasn’t the original Flux, and it was a variant. Everything after Redux was easier. If you understand <a href="https://redux.js.org"><span class="s3">Redux</span></a> then it’s pretty nice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">36:07 – Thomas: I think <a href="https://redux.js.org"><span class="s3">Redux</span></a> was the biggest headache for me. When you are starting off it’s magic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">36:38 – Tomas: I like when people don’t over-engineer things. I am happy from time-to-time if you need Redux, great, if not then that’s fine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">37:28 – Chuck: Let’s do picks! Where can people find you, Tomas? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">37:35 – Tomas: <a href="https://medium.com/@tomas.eglinskas"><span class="s3">Medium.</span></a> There are other things I want to talk about, so Medium is a good platform. A little bit of GitHub, too. I follow Twitter people, but I’m not active. In Europe, people use Twitter – we follow the famous people, but aren’t that active.</span></p>
