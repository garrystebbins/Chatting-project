<p class="p1"><span class="s3">In this episode, the React Round Up Charles speaks with <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ethomson"><span class="s4">Ed Thomson</span></a> who is a Program Manager at Azure through Microsoft, Developer, and Open Source Maintainer. Ed and Chuck discuss in full detail about Azure DevOps! Check out today’s episode to hear its new features and other exciting news! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">0:59 – Live at Microsoft Ignite</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03 – Ed: Hi! I am a Program Manager at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/"><span class="s4">Azure.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:28 – Rewind 2 episodes to hear more about Azure DevOps!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:51 – Ed: One of the moves from Pipelines to DevOps – they could still adopt Pipelines. Now that they are separate services – it’s great.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:38 – Chuck talks about features he does and doesn’t use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:54 – Ed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:00 – Chuck: Repos and Pipelines. I am going to dive right in. Let’s talk about Repos. Microsoft just acquired GitHub. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:18 – Ed: Technically we have not officially acquired GitHub. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:34 – Chuck: It’s not done. It’s the end of September now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:55 – Ed: They will remain the same thing for a while. GitHub is the home for open source. Repos – we use it in Microsoft. Repositories are huge. There are 4,000 engineers working in these repositories. Everyone works in his or her own little area, and you have to work together. You have to do all this engineering to get there. We bit a tool and it basically if you run clone...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Ed continues to talk about this topic. He is talking about One Drive and these repositories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:28 – Ed: We aren’t going to be mixing and matching. I used to work through GitHub. It’s exciting to see those people work close to me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:54 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:59 – Ed: It has come a long way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:07 – Chuck: Beyond the FSF are we talking about other features or?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:21 – Ed: We have unique features. We have branch policies. You can require that people do pole request. You have to use pole request and your CI has to pass and things like that. I think there is a lot of richness in our auditing. We have enterprise focus. At its core it still is Git. We can all interoperate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:17 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:37 – Ed: You just can’t set it up with Apache. You have to figure it out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:51 – Chuck: The method of pushing and pulling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:06 – Chuck: You can try DevOps for free up to 5 users and unlimited private repos. People are interested in this because GitHub makes you pay for that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:38 – Ed and Chuck continue to talk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:50 – Ed: Pipelines is the most interesting thing we are working on. We have revamped the entire experience. Build and release. It’s easy to get started. We have a visual designer. Super helpful – super straightforward. Releases once your code is built – get it out to production say for example Azure. It’s the important thing to get your code out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:55 – Chuck: How can someone start with this? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:00 – Ed: Depends on where your repository is. It will look at your code. “Oh, I know what that is, I know how to build that!” Maybe everyone isn’t doing everything with JavaScript. If you are using DotNet then it will know. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:05 – Chuck: What if I am using both a backend and a frontend?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:11 – Ed: One repository? That’s when you will have to do a little hand packing on the...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">There are different opportunities there. If you have a bash script that does it for you. If not, then you can orchestrate it. Reduce the time it takes. If it’s an open source project; there’s 2 – what are you going to do with the other 8? You’d be surprised – people try to sneak that in there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:30 – Chuck: It seems like continuous integration isn’t a whole lot complicated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:39 – Ed: I am a simple guy that’s how I do it. You can do advanced stuff, though. The Cake Build system – they are doing some crazy things. We have got Windows, Lennox, and others. Are you building for Raspberries Pies, then okay, do this...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It’s not just running a script.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:00 – Chuck: People do get pretty complicated if they want. It can get complicated. Who knows?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:26 – Chuck:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How much work do you have to do to set-up a Pipeline like that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:37 – Ed answers the question in detail.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:03 – Chuck asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:12 – Ed: Now this is where it gets contentious. If one fails...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Our default task out of the box...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:56 – Chuck: If you want 2 steps you can (like me who is crazy).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:05 – Ed: Yes, I want to see if it failed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:17 – Chuck: Dude, writing code is hard. Once you have it built and tested – continuous deployment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:33 – Ed: It’s very easy. It’s super straightforward, it doesn’t have to be <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/?&amp;OCID=AID719825_SEM_fNqQIgDa&amp;lnkd=Google_Azure_Brand&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4pTVroeH3gIVkrrACh3N8A_jEAAYASAAEgKhmPD_BwE&amp;dclid=CPuwl7CHh94CFUyvTwod64QINA"><span class="s4">Azure</span></a> (although I hope it is!). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Ed continues this conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:43 – Chuck: And it just pulls it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:49 – Ed: Don’t poke holes into your firewall. We do give you a lot of flexibility </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:04 – Chuck: VPN credentials?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:10 – Ed: Just run the...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:25 – Chuck comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:36 – Ed: ...Take that Zip...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:02 – Ed: Once the planets are finely aligned then...it will just pull from it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:25 – Chuck: I host my stuff on Digital Ocean. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:46 – Ed: It’s been awhile since I played with...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:55 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:59 – Ed and Chuck go back and forth with different situations and hypothetical situations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:10 – Ed: What is Phoenix?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:20 – Chuck explains it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:25 – Ed: Here is what we probably don’t have is a lot of <a href="http://www.erlang.org/community"><span class="s4">ERLANG</span></a> support. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:41 – Advertisement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:31 – Chuck: Let’s just say it’s a possibility. We took the strip down node and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:49 – Ed: I think it’s going to happen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:55 – Ed: Exactly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:02 – Chuck: Testing against Azure services. So, it’s one thing to run on my machine but it’s another thing when other things connect nicely with an Azure set-up. Does it connect natively once it’s in the Azure cloud?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:35 – Ed: It should, but there are so many services, so I don’t want to say that everything is identical. We will say yes with an asterisk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:07 – Chuck: With continuous deployment...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:41 – Ed: As an example: I have a CD Pipeline for my website. Every time I merge into master...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Ed continues this hypothetical situation with full details. Check it out! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:03 – Chuck: You probably can do just about anything – deploy by Tweet!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:15 – Ed: You can stop the deployment if people on Twitter start complaining.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:40 – Chuck: That is awesome! IF it is something you care about – and if it’s worth the time – then why not? If you don’t have to think about it then great. I have mentioned this before: Am I solving interesting problems? What projects do I want to work on? What kinds of contributions do I really want to contribute to open source? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">That’s the thing – if you have all these tools that are set-up then your process, how do you work on what, and remove the pain points then you can just write code so people can use! That’s the power of this – because it catches the bug before I have to catch it – then that saves me time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:08 – Ed: That’s the dream of computers is that the computers are supposed to make OUR lives easier. IF we can do that and catch those bugs before you catch it then you are saving time. Finding bugs as quickly as possible it avoids downtime and messy deployments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:03 – Chuck: Then you can use time for coding style and other things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I can take mental shortcuts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:37 – Ed: The other thing you can do is avoiding security problems. If a static code analysis tool catches an integer overflow then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:30 – Chuck adds his comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck: You can set your policy to block it or ignore it. Then you are running these tools to run security. There are third-party tools that do security analysis on your code. Do you integrate with those?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:00 – Ed: Yep. My favorite is <a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/how-does-it-work/"><span class="s4">WhiteSource.</span></a> It knows all of the open source and third-party tools. It can scan your code and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:05 – Chuck: It works with a lot of languages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:14 – Ed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:25 – Chuck: A lot of JavaScript developers are getting into mobile development, like Ionic, and others. You have all these systems out there for different stages for writing for mobile. Android, windows Phone, Blackberry...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:04 – Ed: Let’s throw out Blackberry builds. We will ignore it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Mac OS dies a fine job. That’s why we have all of those.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:29 – Chuck: But I want to run my tests, too! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:36 – Ed: I really like to use App Center. It is ultimately incredible to see all the tests you can run. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:29 – Chuck: The deployment is different, though, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:40 – Ed: I have a friend who clicks a button in...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Azure DevOps. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:00 – Chuck: I like to remind people that this isn’t a new product.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:15 – Ed: Yes, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-devops/"><span class="s4">Azure DevOps.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:24 – Chuck: Any new features that are coming out?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:27 – Ed: We took a little break, but...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:47 – Ed: We will pick back up once Ignite is over. We have a timeline on our website when we expect to launch some new features, and some are secret, so keep checking out the website. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:07 – Chuck: What is the interplay between <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-devops/"><span class="s4">Azure DevOps</span></a> and Visual Studio Code? Because they have plugins for freaking everything. I am sure there is something there that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:30 – Ed: I am a VI guy and I’m like 90% sure there is something there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">You are an eMac’s guy? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The way I think about it is through Git right out of the box. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Yes, I think there are better things out there for integration. I know we have a lot of great things in Visual Code, because I worked with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:45 – Chuck: Yes, people can look for extensions and see what the capabilities are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck talks about code editor and tools. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:28 – Ed: ... we have been pulling that out as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">We do have IE extensions, I am sure there is something for VS Code – but it’s not where I want to spend my time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:02 – Chuck: Yes, sure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:07 – Ed: But everyone is different – they won’t work the way that I work. So there’s that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:30 – Ed: That Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:36 – Chuck: Where do people get news?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:42 – Ed: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min"><span class="s4">Go to here!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:54 – Chuck: Where do people find you?</span></p>
