Joined by Special Guest: Parashuram
### **Summary**
Parashuram (aka Ram) and the panel compares various frameworks including the differences between React Native and NativeScript. Ram discusses what it’s like introducing react native to mobile teams which leads to a panel discussion of web app developer experience compared to mobile app developers. Ram shares the changes that are being made to React Native and what this means for its developers. Some of the things to look forward to are a leaner and more browser-like React Native.&nbsp; The episode ends with Ram sharing a little of his story.
