**Special Guests** : Paul Gray

In this episode of React Round Up, the panel discusses the future of higher order components and render props with Paul Gray. Paul is a software developer at an educational technology company called [Learning Objects](https://learningobjects.com/#/). They have a learning platform there that helps instructional designers create better contents. They talk about how he got into programming and [React](https://reactjs.org/), when you would want to use HOCs and render props, and [chainable components](https://github.com/pfgray/chainable-components).
