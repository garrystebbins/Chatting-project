### **Episode Summary&nbsp;**

In this episode of React Round Up, Jared Palmer, Lead Engineer at Palmer Group, gives the listeners an overview of React Suspense, how it helps to resolve conflicts with resource scheduling and how it differs from current practices. He mentions that it is developed completely by the React team and talks about some of its applications, especially in handling images. He explains how React Suspense will reduce code size for loading states, the mechanism of parallel execution and how complexity in logic can be simplified with it. Jared also mentions some modules where Suspense can already be integrated with and advises on where it is not recommended to be used yet. The panelists then discuss server-side rendering with Suspense and their approach in technology adoption, which is incremental. Finally they talk about Redux and move on to picks.
