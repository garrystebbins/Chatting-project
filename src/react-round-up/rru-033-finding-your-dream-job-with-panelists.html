<p class="p1"><span class="s4">In this episode, the panel talks amongst themselves about: What is THE dream job? How do you define YOUR dream job? And how do you GET your dream job? Check out today’s episode to find out more! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:02 – What does a dream job even mean?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:08 – Nader: It means that you wake-up and you are excited to go to work instead of dreading it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:34 – Lucas: Dream jobs I think change depending on your life’s moments. It changes from person-to-person and from time-to-time. After some months there you are feeling like you are always growing as a person and as a professional. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:24 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:38 – Justin: My idea is that it has some impact on the people in your world. What is my impact on the world – what is my footprint – what am I doing? My last job was advertisement, and my job was to drive eyeballs to ads. That wasn’t what I wanted to do anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">3:49 – Charles: What do I want to do with DevChat? It’s not always fun, and why am I doing this. For me it’s personal freedom and an impact within the world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">What are your big three that will make a big difference to you? There are all sorts of reasons, but once you know that then it’s easier. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">When my resume comes across their desk it comes with an endorsement. If you don’t have anything else to sell them, especially if you are a new developer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">The last few jobs you’ve gotten how did you find them?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">6:25 – Nader.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">6:52 – Panelists: Recruiters. I used that to build myself up. Then I got into: Where DO I want to work? I will check Twitter, GitHub, Hacker News, and I keep my eyes open. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">At Artsy we try to build on those relationships. We are hiring! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">8:31 – Chuck: I think most companies are like that – they will hire the people that they know. Doing the research, figuring out what company you want </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">9:10 – Panelists: Don’t be afraid to meet-up with people and ask them questions. You aren’t just trying to leech off of them and figure out what YOU can contribute back.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">9:47 – Chuck: Even if you are trying to network with people to get a job – make sure you don’t look like you are trying to leech off of them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">10:20 – Lucas: When I moved to the U.S. about a year ago...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">A question I asked myself: Where will I contribute well? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">There are some markets that I am not interested in and there are some that I am interested in – that’s where I want to go. I like helping people with their health. Their website (company I am working for) is very eCommerce like. I know I can contribute, and it’s a mission that I am all about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Where do MY skillsets help?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">For junior levels time is on your side – contribute your time. You can help them with </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">When you are young you have time. Everyone can follow their skillset. Try to find the places where you want and where do you want to contribute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">13:06 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">13:20 – Even senior engineers we undervalue ourselves – it’s easy to do. When friends are trying to break into the industry I tell them to track their projects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">14:26 – Chuck: It shows the eagerness to learn and be willing to learn and contribute. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">On GitHub – be consistent with your contributions; it shows initiative. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">15:33 – Nader, how did you get your job?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">15:40 – Nader: Developer Advocate is the job I have now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><i>Nader talks about how he got his current job. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">The main thing that I would recommend is to learn in public. Even if it’s not that impressive – overtime you will standout. It’s all about standing out, because you don’t want to sell yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">17:52 – <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=%257Efreshbooks&amp;kw=fresh%2520books&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=53169078638&amp;kwid=kwd-299596828929&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=289653575014&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwr_9ofSJ3gIVyrfACh1DkQVNEAAYASAAEgJIUvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CPaQ6KX0id4CFUTcwAodvfQEcA"><span class="s3">Advertisement – Fresh Books!</span></a> 30-day trial.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">18:58 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">19:20 – Lucas: I am doing a lot of interviews now – a lot of times we want to hire people but we can’t for a certain skillset. One interesting thing is that even though you have an initial “no,” we could use that person later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">20:04 – Chuck: If it comes down to a good relationship then you can make that work to your advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">People should be following-up to see if HR is reposting the job. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Give them a lot of reasons to hire you!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">22:30 – Panelist: If you aren’t excited to work there then it’s really telling. Searching for any opportunity just to grow is okay but it will be telling to your possible future employers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">23:40 – Chuck: Nader talked about standing out, and here you are talking about the same thing. Nobody goes to this level of effort to get a job at a company. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">24:13 – Lucas: Do you think this applies to the big companies like Facebook or Google?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">24:28 – Nader: I think these same principles do apply. When you start thinking about these big companies as actual people – then you have a better shot of getting hired. Go through Meetups and finding people who work there. Building relationships is what it’s about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">25:40 – Chuck: Companies are made-up of people – that’s it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Sometimes the company will go to bat for you and try to convince HR that you could be the right person. Give them reasons to hire you – sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">27:03 – Lucas: Sometimes you THINK you want to work for a company, but how do I gather that this is the correct decision. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">In the middle of the interview – I realized that this wasn’t the right place for me. How do I got about that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">27:50 – Chuck: I lay out the TOP Three in my eBook. The best place to find out this information is finding out through past or current employees through X company. A lot of information, too, you can get through GlassDoor. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">You can do a people search through LinkedIn. Have that conversation with them over lunch and ask them those questions and find out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">31:48 – Justin: As you are reaching out to these people, keep them in mind as a possible mentor. Someone who you can learn from and that they can possibly mentor you. I think that can be undervalued. Really focus on “is this someone I could build a relationship with to help me with my career.” The relationship is a give and take – you don’t want that to show through. You should be interested in the person and helping them in some way, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">33:11 – Chuck: I agree.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Chuck talks about mentor / advisor relationship some more. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">34:00 – Lucas asks Chuck some questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Lucas: Some people have a difficult time reaching out – what are some great tips for this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">34:31 – Chuck: Everyone is different. For me, I have to put out a certain number. You have to be willing to go out and do it. If you can’t work with people, then sorry tough luck. Nowadays you will be working with a team of other programmers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Relationships are all about give-and-take; like my wife and me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">36:17 – If you aren’t comfortable in social situations there are things to slowly get you comfortable. Maybe send a tweet through Twitter. Being visible and contribute to slowly put yourself out there. Do whatever you feel comfortable with and challenge yourself just to TRY. Most people aren’t trying.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">37:45 – Chuck: Sometimes that direct approach is or isn’t there. You can strike up a conversation about code and then it can go from there. It can happen in stages. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">38:37 – If our experiences don’t align then that’s okay. Really try. Make sure you put in more effort than the people that are applying just via their website. Do more than just the </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">39:17 – Chuck: The more <b><i>personal</i></b> you can make it the better chance you have of getting hired. </span></p>
