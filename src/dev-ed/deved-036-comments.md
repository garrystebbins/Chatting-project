In this week's episode of the DevEd podcast, the panelists talk about code comments. To give a context of the chosen topic, Joe mentions that he sends out regular newsletters to Thinkser.io subscribers related to a variety of concepts. He has recently been sending out some on code smells, gives an idea of what code smells are, and in one of those he talks about code comments. A comment can be looked at as a failure or an inability to express the code function or the functionality, or to be completely readable to other programmers. Comments can also become out of date or get replaced. 

The other panelists share their opinion on whether comments can be good or bad, they state that for beginners they can be very useful while for experienced programmers, not so much.
