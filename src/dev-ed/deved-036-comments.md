In this week's episode of the DevEd podcast, the panelists talk about code comments. To give a context of the chosen topic, Joe mentions that he sends out regular newsletters to Thinkser.io subscribers related to a variety of concepts, and has recently been sending out some on code smells, in one of which he talks about code comments. He gives an idea of what code smells are, and shares his opinion on using comments. A comment can be looked at as a failure or an inability to express the code function or even the technology, or to make the code completely readable to other programmers. Comments can also become out of date or get replaced.

The other panelists join in the discussion on whether comments can be good or bad, they state that for beginners they can be very useful while for experienced programmers, not so much. Too many comments can cause a mess, so they ideally should be used for large complex functions. They are mostly used to specify if refactoring is needed at a later stage, they should explain the "why" instead of "how", and in general the code should be self-sufficient. 

They talk about when do they actually like to use comments. If a certain piece of code is doing something unusual or non-obvious or might break the consistency with the rest of the code, then it is imperative to explain why it is written in that way. It can also be a good idea to document things for new or junior developers on the team in order to explain what is going on or what should not be done, and also to pair program with them in case things are not clear. Commit messages can be a replacement for comments as well. Comments are also useful when static values and constants such as URLs or UIDs are used in the code, and in explaining specific error mechanisms.

They share great practical advice for programmers who are in the earlier stages of their software development career and have been generally taught to use comments by their professors or mentors. The tips they give include taking time to look through the codebase, checking how and where comments are being used by other developers, refactoring code to write more readable functions wherever things are unclear, using good naming conventions, trying to write self-documenting code, asking a lot of questions to whoever has written the code including the reasons why it is written a certain way and not being afraid to add comments of your own.

They then discuss some replies to the newsletter sent by Joe about code smells at length about the importance of comments in the messy reality of engineering, pros and cons of their usefulness, tradeoff between maintaining self-documenting vs heavily documented code. They end the show with picks.
