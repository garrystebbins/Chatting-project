This week's episode of the DevEd podcast is joined by Hudson Baker. Hudson has been a developer for five years now, specializing in Angular, and is currently working at BrieBug Software. They kickstart the show by answering the basic question - What is Gatsby? Sam explains that it is a static site generator which means that it takes in the data, and converts into static files that can be hosted on any server. It has a lot of tooling and build process stuff built in, and uses modern javascript concepts along with things like GraphQL to build fast performance static sites. It is also a part of JAMStack.

Speaking on what languages and technologies it is based on, Sam elaborates that Gatsby is built with React, the build process is webpack, the content can be written in markdown or any outside sources, and data querying is done with GraphQL. The next topic of discussion is static sites. They talk at length about what static sites are, if they can be written without a static site generator, the difference between Gatsby and other frameworks such as Angular and React, what makes sites static, how to identify them, and how to make a clear distinction between static and dynamic sites.

Gatsby can be a good starting point for people interested in learning React, because it has many cool inbuilt tools, plugins and pre-packaged templates which make the learning process easier than starting React from scratch. From a teaching perspective, React is a better choice if the goal is to teach web applications, whereas Gatsby is good for knowing how to build websites.
