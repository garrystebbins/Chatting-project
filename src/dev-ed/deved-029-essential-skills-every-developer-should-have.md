## Episode Summary

In this episode of the Dev Ed podcast, the panelists talk to recurring special guest Aspen Payton, who is currently working as a Lead Analyst Programmer at Mayo Clinic, has been in the software industry for about 20 years, and has over 32 granted patents to her name. Joe starts the discussion by giving a background on why he chose to talk about the essential skills developers need to possess. He divides the topic into different types of skills and poses the first question to the panel - what fundamental technical skills should every developer have. Brooke shares her bootcamp experience and stresses the importance of learning basic command line operations. 

Sam mentions debugging with console.log in any language on any environment and explains how it can be a saviour while troubleshooting all kinds of situations. Luis says that it is important to know how to efficiently use the editor, understand related tools and know how to type faster. Joe agrees and shares a funny anecdote from his initial days as a fast typist. Aspen mentions coding efficiently, reducing duplication and writing reusable code as some of the most essential skills. 

The panelists then discuss the pros and cons the AHA (Avoid Hasty Abstractions) term, the gist of which is to remove duplication when you see it happening _more_ than once and to prefer abstraction over duplication.
