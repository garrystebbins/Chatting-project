## Episode Summary

This episode of the Dev Ed podcast is joined by Mike Brocchi, currently working as a Front-End Developer for Ultimate Software, and has done significant work on the Angular CLI in the past. Joe begins the show by asking the panel what reinventing oneself means to them leading to an interesting discussion. They each share some triggers which made them think about changing course or or starting over again. They share their own experiences where they ended up reconsidering their life choices due to certain roadblocks ultimately resulting in a fulfilling and happy career. They discuss how comfort works against all of this, and how reinventing does not necessarily needs to be a better job or higher salary, it can simply mean choosing something satisfying and challenging.
