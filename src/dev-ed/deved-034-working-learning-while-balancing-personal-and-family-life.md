In this week's episode of the DevEd podcast, the panelists talk to Tara Z. Manicsic. Tara is an Angular Developer Experience Engineer at Netlify, a blogger, and loves to work in her community to educate and learn from other developers. The topic for this episode is work-life balance with an emphasis on balancing learning as a programmer.

The first thing they discuss is if programmers are good at balancing work-life. The general consensus is that they aren't, but mostly because they love the job they do, and it is also fun to learn newer technologies and concepts. They talk about hackations and coding in beautiful environments away from the regular desks.

They talk about some strategies to maintain a good work-life balance especially in high-pressure scenarios where the work seems to never get over. They suggest time management, blocking off hours and segregating them into strictly work and non-work periods. Tara mentions working non-traditional hours while having an infant at home, Brooke explains how to schedule things beforehand so that knowing the tasks ahead of time helps in managing them effectively. Others chip in with their suggestions as well. Tara also speaks on the importance of having a good manager with realistic expectations.

They then touch on work-life balance from the perspective of managers too, where they advise them to make sure that the employees work reasonable hours, check in with them regularly and encourage them to take personal time off for their own mental health. They share their experiences related to death marches and the stress associated with it. While working as a junior developer in a high pressure environment that is hard to keep up with, it can be hard to change jobs. To deal with these kind of situations, they talk about how important it is to like the work being done, and if it is not something enjoyable, it is time to start looking for something different or take some time to unwind. Trying to do interesting things such as reading books, listening to music or podcasts, etc at work during lunchtime or so can also help in thriving in such environments. 

The next point discussed is how to deal with the need to learn along with working at a regular job and still manage to maintain a balance.  Consuming relevant content in the background while going about our day-to-day chores, not underestimating the learning done on the job, carving out time for self development during work hours, writing blog posts of things learned which will eventually lead to an awesome portfolio are some great recommendations.

The last thing the panelists talk about is organizational tools for an awesome work-learn-life balance. They suggest Toggle, Asana, OmniFocus and Calendar. Luis mentions that given that we are constantly bombarded with information, it can be beneficial to sift through that, remove the unnecessary noise and concentrate on what is needed to free up significant amount of time. Joe recommends using a bullet journal, being physical and tactile while organising rather than digital, and Mike suggests switching the airplane mode on. Tara and Sam talk about meditation and mindfulness. They end the show with picks.
