### **Episode Summary**

In this episode of the Dev Ed podcast, Kim Maida, Community and Technical Content Manager at Auth0, kicks off the show by talking about her diverse career path and how she got into web development. She also touches on her role in the field of authentication and identity at her current company. Sam Julien also briefly shares his experience working for Auth0. Kim explains the terminology of authentication and identity in the context of web development and the concepts of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. She then recommends some resources for listeners interested in these subjects and stresses on the fact that learning paths should be different based on individual goals.

The panelists then explain why these security-related topics can seem daunting to beginners, given the vulnerabilities and risks involved, and the importance of getting things right. They discuss at what point in a developer’s career is most advantageous for getting into authentication, how the teaching techniques can be perfected, when to take help from expert services vs when to develop the features themselves, and how to break barriers in learning authentication when things get tricky and complicated. Kim answers questions from the panelists on which would be some of the hardest concepts to explain to users, the average learning curve for developers, using cookies or tokens as a basis for authentication and locations for storing them. Sam talks about the value in using service providers such as Auth0 and also about other currently available services. They finally discuss the need for authentication in areas such as IoT, biometrics, etc. going forward, and the downsides of offloading all of the user data to a single authentication server.
