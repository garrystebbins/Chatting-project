In this episode of the Dev Ed podcast, Ben Halpern, the creator and co-founder of [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), talks about the company, his career background and current work. He explains what the Dev.to community consists of, differences between registered and guest users, how the website gets sponsorship, and some of its other features.

They comment on the steps that can be taken by users to make online communities a positive and uplifting experience for everyone involved, while sharing their own experiences and giving examples.
