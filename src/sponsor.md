If you're trying to find developers who are striving for excellence and looking for the best resources and tools, you're in the right place.

Our mission is to produce a podcast for every programming community that leads them to build successful careers and meaningful lives.

We only promote brands and products that help developers grow success in their careers or lead better lives. We don't compromise on our mission or our listeners' trust for sponsorships.

Our podcast listeners range from new programmers and DevOps engineers learning the craft up to Directors and CTO's. We receive a steady stream of "thank you"s from our listeners who are finding better jobs, learning new skills, and building software they care about.

Our podcasts topics include front-end and back-end development languages and frameworks, mobile development paradigms, careers, learning, and DevOps.

This list is sorted by listenership.
