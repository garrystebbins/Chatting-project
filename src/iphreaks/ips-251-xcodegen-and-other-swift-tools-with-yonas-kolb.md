 **Panel:**

Jaim Zuber

**Special Guest:** Yonas Kolb

In today’s episode, the iPhreaks panel talks to Yonas Kolb about XcodeGen and other Swift tools. Yonas works on a number of open source projects that Jaim has been working with recently, notably [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint), and [Beak](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Beak). They talk about what each of these open source tools are and do, use cases for XcodeGen, and the benefits of checking in VS not checking in. They also touch on obscure things you can do with XcodeGen, how he started the project, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
