  In today’s episode, the iPhreaks panel talk about Andrew’s client project that he’s been working on. To combat an issue, he has been using the audio port on the iPhone in order to transport data. With this, you don’t need any approval from Apple and the hardware is very simple. They go more in depth about how this process works and how iPhone updates affect it, such as the loss of the headphone jack. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:&nbsp;**
