 **Panel:**

- Jaim Zuber
- Erica Sadun

**Special Guest:** Shai Mishali

In today’s episode, the iPhreaks panel talks to Shai Mishali about RxSwift. Shai is an iOS engineer who started his career as a backend engineer. Currently, he is in charge of the Tim Horton’s iOS app, and in his free time he does a lot of open source, specifically within the [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) community. They talk about how he got into programming, the difference between [React](https://reactjs.org/) and RxSwift, and they explain [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/). They also touch on the downsides of Rx, how debugging works, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Shai intro
- How did you get into developing?
- Grew up interested in technology
- How was it learning when you’re not a native English speaker?
- Language barrier
- Do you consider yourself an Apple developer?
- Still does some backend work in [Swift](https://swift.org/)
- Tackles whatever challenges come into his path
- How are [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) different?
- React is a technology that is built on one big idea
- Big idea behind React
- Is there a model that iOS developers use that is similar to how React/Reactive programming works?
- [RxFeedback](https://github.com/NoTests/RxFeedback.swift)
- Explain [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/)
- Observables & Binding
- What are the downsides of Rx?
- Does Rx feel like functional programming, or the delegate pattern?
- How does Rx simplify your life?
- How do you avoid the pitfalls in Rx?
- How does debugging work?
- And much, much more!
