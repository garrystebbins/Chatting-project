**Episode Summary**


In this episode of The iPhreaks Show, the panel interview Brian Voong. Brian runs a YouTube channel where he teaches about iOS development. The episode of his channel that the panel discusses with him is about the Roadmap to iOS development. Brian starts by giving a brief overview of what his video contains and how it is given with the intent to help developers find jobs in the iOS industry.

The YouTube video has over 40,000 views and the panel wonders who are all these people watching this video. Brian explains that YouTube is a major resource for many people learning about development. Also this video appeals not only to beginners but also mid-level and senior developers who want to know what to learn next. The video features a diagram that depicts the roadmap an iOS developer should follow, so people are interested to see where they stand. 

The panel dives into nitpicks of the roadmap. The panel disagrees that Swift is considered functional programming only. Functional programming on the map is at the top but the panel debates whether or not it should be further down on the map. The panel considers functional programmings place now that functional programming is becoming more prominent in the iOS world, especially with the Combine framework coming out. The panel points out that Swiftjective C is missing and wonders if it should have been included. 

Once you have mastered the basics the panel wonders at what is the most important thing to learn. Brian explains to those who can see the diagram that there are close to 50 subjects listed for developers to learn. He chooses a few he thinks are the most important subjects to learn if a developer is hoping to get hired soon. He lists: learning how to work with a database, create crud screens, interact with restful API’s and do some effective network programming. Brain describes these as items to get your feet wet. 

The panel explains that you don’t need to know all of the items on the roadmap in order to get a job. It is more important to have all the basics and good problem-solving skills. Brian does mention some of the skills at the bottom of the roadmap that might be good to learn, such as Build Config, Jenkins and knowing how to deploy an app.

Looking at the map, the panel wonders at the best way to read it. Initially, they assumed top to bottom would be best and in order of priority. Seeing deployment at the bottom, the panel describes the roadmap as more of a life cycle because they consider deployment a skill every beginner should have.  

The panel gives advice to new developers. It might seem that you need to learn all this stuff and then start coding but the panel explains that the best way to learn is through coding, running into problems and learning these skills to solve them. The panel compares it to learning a spoken language, in the beginning, it is about making yourself understood and as you speak it your grasp of the language will grow. They suggest letting the subjects find you when you need them instead of seeking them out. 

Brian explains why he recommends learning Jenkins near the beginning. He explains that so many junior developers have the exact same skill set and by knowing something like Jenkins you can set yourself apart from the rest. The panel shares why it may be important to know some CI stuff and be able to do a few things with it. 

The last topic they discuss in this episode is what tips and tools a developer should learn listed under the tips and tools heading on the roadmap. Brian suggests Break Point and Instrument. The panel explains what Instrument is most useful for, finding excessive memory usage and performance problems.
