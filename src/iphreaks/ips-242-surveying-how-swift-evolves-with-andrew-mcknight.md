**Special Guest: Andrew McKnight**

In today's episode, the iPheaks panelist speak with Andrew McKnight about Surveying How Swift Evolves. Andrew provides information on a presentation he did at iOS Dev Camp Colorado, on a survey looking at the open source Swift repositories to see how developers are extending the language, foundation, or standard library. This is a great episode to gain insight into how developers on the iOS platform are helping evolve the Swift language and much more.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- What was being surveyed? - Utility Libraries and general purpose
- How did you search for Utility Libraries?
- What is the purpose of the utility libraries?
- Duplicate extensions
- What are the most popular extensions that are recreated?
- String and Trim
- What is trim()?
- Why is targeting utility libraries problematic?
- What is the goal?
- Did you find wrong or dangerous implementations?
- Why is their discussion/drama around gathering these extensions?
- Would these be good topics to file Radars?
- Brisk -&nbsp;[https://github.com/br1sk/brisk](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk)
- What is it like entering the Swift Evolution Process?
- Can a community-driven proposal gain traction?
- Did you look into custom types like Result\<T\>?
- And much much more!
