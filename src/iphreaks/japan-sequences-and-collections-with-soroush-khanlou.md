At the try! Swift conference in Japan, Soroush talked about sequence and collections. Although they are no longer new, things can get confusing when people start to dig into them. There are important and deep parts of the library. You can choose a particular behavior by conforming to a specific type, but actions become more effective when there is good understanding of certain particles.

## How Sequences and Collections Work

Soroush&nbsp;explains that sequences are the simplest type available. It provides a make-iterator function, which conforms to a special protocol. The protocol then has a next() function that can be called repeatedly until it gives a no, signifying the end of a sequence. From a simple behavior, the library builds a lot of functionalities.
