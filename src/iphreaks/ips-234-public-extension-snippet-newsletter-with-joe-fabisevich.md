  **Special Guest:** Joe Fabisevich In today’s episode, the iPhreaks panel talk to Joe Fabisevich about the new mailing list that he has recently taken over, and you can sign up for it [here](https://www.getrevue.co/). He talks about the type of snippets that they send out in the newsletter and gives general information about the newsletter.
