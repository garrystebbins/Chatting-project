In today’s episode, the iPhreaks panel talk about Marizipan. Marzipan is the compatibility layer that Apple invented in order to bring [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit) apps to Mac. They talk about the rumors behind the creation of Marzipan, why Apple is waiting until next year to launch it, and discuss what will make these new Mac apps iOS capable. They also touch on how you can run iOS apps on the Mac prior to Marzipan’s release, [Marzipanify](https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/marzipanify), and much more!
