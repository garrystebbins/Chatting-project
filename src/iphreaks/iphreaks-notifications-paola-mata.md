## iPhreaks Notifications&nbsp;-&nbsp;Paola Mata

On episode 190 of iPhreaks, Andrew and Jaim&nbsp;discuss **Notifications with Paola Mata**. Paola is an iOS Swift Developer and organizer of NYC Tech Latinas. Tune in to learn more about notifications and how she got interested in it.

## Interest in Notifications

Paola's interest in notifications started when she attended last year's WWDC.&nbsp;One of the talks that really caught her attention was on notifications. She was impressed with how the topic was delivered because it really went through the basics of understanding how things work. Notifications is a topic that is not commonly discussed in detail. So she thought of talking about what she learned in meet-ups. It's a good way to share her knowledge with beginners.

## Uses of Notifications

There are several uses of notifications in general. They&nbsp;help us set time and remind us of our daily activities. They also notify us when there's a new information or any data that needs to be refreshed. In working on her app, notifications help her a lot in planning weekly. They&nbsp;inform her the&nbsp;important items that need to be taken care of.&nbsp;Basically, notifications exist to aid us in organizing and managing our schedule and workload.

## Users' Experience in Notifications

What users see in notifications depend on&nbsp;where they are. Notifications may pop out on&nbsp;their lock screen or may show up as a banner at the top of the screen.&nbsp;They may also come along with sound depending on if the user made it available on his gadget. Paola also discussed other types of push notifications and the difference between a push and local notification.
