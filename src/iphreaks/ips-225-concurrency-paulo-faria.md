**Panel:** Andrew Madsen Erica Sadun **Special Guests:** Paul Faria In today's episode, iPhreaks speaks with Paulo Faria. Paulo is based in Brazil and has been developing for the OSX platform since 2012. Also,&nbsp; Paulo mentions focusing on server side development and working in iOS and Android development. Paulo is the creator of Zewo and one of the first to work with server-side Swift. Paulo is on iPheaks to talks about Concurrency.&nbsp; Paul believes that concurrency is the missing feature to make it a true and mature ecosystem for server-side on Swift. **In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
