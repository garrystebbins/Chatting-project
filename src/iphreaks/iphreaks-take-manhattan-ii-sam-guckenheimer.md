## iPhreaks Take Manhattan II -&nbsp;Sam Guckenheimer
On episode 191&nbsp;of iPhreaks, Andrew and Jaim&nbsp;discuss **iPhreaks&nbsp;**** Take Manhattan II with Sam Guckenheimer.** Sam is the Group Product Planner of the Visual Studio Team Services of Microsoft. In the last 6 years, he has been working on Microsoft's transformation from Agile to DevOps. Tune into&nbsp;their exciting talk, and learn about it!
## DevOps Overview
DevOps is basically about validated learning. Whenever you build software, you'd find out that the process&nbsp;you are doing&nbsp;initially supports your hypothesis of your expected result. About a&nbsp;third of the time, it becomes contradicting then next it doesn't make any difference. What DevOps does is that it automates the build-test-publish cycle, aiming to create an environment where building, testing, and releasing software can frequently happen. Its end result will tell you if the changes you made created a positive&nbsp;difference. You get to see what's really working and receive feedback.
## Different Validation Approach
Lean Startup Validation is the process of taking an application and figuring out what&nbsp;people are using.&nbsp;It&nbsp;determines which features people care about. However, Sam presents a different approach in validation&nbsp;through data collection. This method helps&nbsp;back up claims that users care about a particular feature. Visual Studio Mobile Center lets you setup a test automation&nbsp;across all real devices using the Test Cloud. The results directly return&nbsp;back into your build. After the results, you get to&nbsp;see&nbsp;the test and visual logs. You then publish instrumentation using&nbsp;the HockeyApp which works for both androids and iOS.
## On HockeyApp
Since HockeyApp has the benefit of working across two platforms, android and iOS, you see results in one place from all the data. You then&nbsp;get to observe what your inner users are doing and make decisions if it's good for blogger release and publishing. You have to&nbsp;continue monitoring what's happening once in a while.
