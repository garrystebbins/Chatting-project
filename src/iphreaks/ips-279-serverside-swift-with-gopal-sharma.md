In this episode of the iPhreaks Show the panel interviews Gopal Sharma who gave a talk at try! Swift 2018 about serverside Swift. He starts by sharing his background and how got into building stuff for the serverside. In his talk, Gopal outlined what is expected in a serverside framework and explains where Swift was at.

Its been over a year since his talk and Gopal tells the panel that things have improved for serverside Swift since then. 

Gopal explains that the real reason to use serverside Swift is for Neo. Vapor and Kitura are the Swift frameworks built on top of Neo. Gopal compares these too frameworks and walks the panel through the specifics of each one. They discuss how each handles requests, databases, migration, template-based rendering, and microservice environments.

The panel discusses which frameworks should be used for different projects. They share their preferences for ORMs and weigh the costs and benefits of using ORMs. Gopal explains why he prefers to just use SQL and avoid ORMs. Shawn shares tips for using ORMs and explains how they save him time and make him more efficient.
