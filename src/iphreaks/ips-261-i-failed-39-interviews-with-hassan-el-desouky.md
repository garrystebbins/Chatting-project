### **Episode Summary**
 Hassan El Desouky is a computer science student from Egypt, his dream is to join a big company like Google, Apple, or Facebook. He talks about his experience applying for the big tech companies in his article [How I Failed 39 Interviews and What I’ve Learned](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/how-i-failed-39-interviews-and-what-ive-learned-515c8e6c4b53). Hassan talks about some of the difficulties faced by people from overseas applying for the big American tech companies. He shares some advice for applying and interviewing for big companies that he received from a friend that works at Google.
