In this episode of Views on Vue, the panelists discuss state management with Vue.js with Hassan Djirdeh. Hassan is a front-end engineer developer based out of Toronto, Canada and works for the ecommerce company [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as his full-time job. In his free-time he does anything and everything related to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and has also recently helped publish a book called [_Fullstack Vue_](https://www.fullstack.io/vue/). They talk about [Vue CLI 3.0](https://cli.vuejs.org/), state management patterns, his talk [_The Importance of State Management in Vue_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7g7MOrDtMY), and more!
