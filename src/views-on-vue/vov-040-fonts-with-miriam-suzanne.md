0:53 – Guest: Hello!

1:01 – Guest: I am a designer and a developer and started a business with my brother. We are two college dropouts.

2:00 – Panel: Is that’s why it’s called [OddBird?](http://oddbird.net/authors/miriam/)

2:05 – Guest: Started with Vue and have been talking at conferences.

2:31 – Chuck: Chris invited you and he’s not here today – go figure!

2:47 – Panel: You are big in the CSS world.

2:58 – Guest: That’s where I’ve made my name. I made a grid system that was popular at one moment in time.

3:17 – Panel.

3:27 – Panel: Grid Systems are...

3:36 – _Guest talks about her grid system and how it looked._

4:20 – Panel.

4:24 – _Panel goes back-and-forth!_

5:24 – Chuck.

5:27 – Guest: That’s why grid systems came out in the first place b/c layout was such a nightmare. When I built Susy...

6:02 – How much easier is design today on modern browsers compared to ten years ago when you created Susy?

6:14 – Guest: It can look daunting but there are great guides out there!

7:04 – _Panel asks a question._

7:11 – Guest: We recommend a stack to our clients. We had been using backbone Marinette for a while and we wanted to start messing with others. Looking at other frameworks. Looking at design, I like that Vue doesn’t hide it from me and I can see what I need.

8:41 – Panel: I love that about Vue. I knew this guy named, Hue.

8:54 – Guest: I have been friends with [Sarah Drasner.](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor)

9:07 – Panel: [Sarah](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor) is great she’s on my team.

9:39 – Guest: I had been diving into JavaScript over the summer. I hadn’t done a lot of JS in the past before the summer. I was learning Vanilla JavaScript.

10:21 – Guest: I don’t like how it mixes it all together (in reference to the [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)).

10:44 – _Panel mentions Python and other things. Panelist asks a question._

10:54 – Guest: That would be a question for someone who writes that.

11:30 – Panel: I am going to change topics here for a second. Can you talk about your talk? And what is a design system?

11:48 – _Guest answers the question._

13:26 – _Panel follows-up with another question._

13:35 – _Guest talks about component libraries._

15:30 – Chuck: Do people assume that the component that they have has all the accessibility baked-in b/c everything else does – and turns out it doesn’t?

15:48 – _Guest answers._

Guest: Hopefully it’s marked into the documentation.

16:25 – Panel.

16:36 – Guest: If you don’t document it – it doesn’t exist.

17:01 – Panel.

17:22 – Guest: “How do we sell clients on this?” We don’t – we let them come back and say, “we had to do less upkeep.” If they are following our patterns then...

17:57 – Panel: We’ve had where guides are handed off and it erodes slowly over time. Then people are doing it 10 different ways and not doing it the way it was designed.

18:31 – Guest: Yes, it should be baked-into the design and it shouldn’t be added to the style guide.

19:02 – Chuck: I really love Sass – and CSS – how do you write SASS or CSS with Vue?

19:12 – _Guest answers the question._

19:23 – Chuck: You made my life better!

19:31 – Guest: If you have global files...you can have those imported among other things.

20:11 – Panel: What’s the best way to go about that?

20:24 – _The guest talks about CSS, global designs, among other things._

21:15 – The guest mentions [inverted triangles CSS!](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/managing-large-s-css-projects-using-the-inverted-triangle-architecture-3c03e4b1e6df)

22:12 – Guest: The deeper we get the narrower we get!

22:49 – _Guest mentions scope styles._

23:12 – Panel: That makes total sense! We are using scope everywhere.

23:30 – Guest.

23:36 – Panel: How would you approach this? I start with scope and then I take them out of scope and then usually promote them to import for mix-ins. I wonder where is that border?

24:30 [– Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!](https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/)

25:09 – _Guest answers the question._

25:53 – Panel: It sounds easy at first but when you are designing it you say: I know that isn’t right!

26:13 – Guest: I try to go through a design proposal.

26:27 – _Guest defines the term:_ _reused._

27:04 – Panel.

27:10 – Guest.

27:30 – Panel: We used to have this problem where we got the question of the following: splitting up the CSS bundles.

28:27 – Guest: That is the nice thing of having CSS in components.

28:49 – _Panel asks Miriam a question._

29:02 – Guest: That’s often when someone wants a redesign.

29:54 – Panel: How do you decide on how many fonts to deliver so they don’t take over the size of the browser?

30:09 – Guest: The usual design rule is no more than 2-3 fonts works out well for performance. Try to keep that rule in mind, but you have to consider every unique project. What is more important for THAT project?

31:46 – Panel.

32:21 – _Guest gives recommendations with fonts and font files._

33:37 – Chuck: What are you working on now with Vue?

33:45 – _Guest answers the question._

_The guest talks about collaborative writing._

34:10 – _Miriam continues._

34:55 – Chuck: What was the trickiest part?

35:00 – _Guest answers the question._

36:03 – Guest: It’s called Vue Finder and it’s through open source.

36:39 – Chuck: Any recent talks coming up for you?

36:49 – Guest: I have one tonight and later one in California!

37:02 – Guest: There were several Vue conferences this year that I was sad to have missed.

37:40 – Guest: Are you doing it again?

37:49 – Panel: How many do you attend?

37:57 – Guest: Normally I do 8-10 conferences and then a variety of Meetups.

38:33 – Chuck: Picks! How do people find you?

38:41 – Guest: [OddBird.net](http://oddbird.net) and [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/mirisuzanne?lang=en)
