**Special Guests:** Filipa Lacerda

In this episode of Views on Vue, the panelists discuss building modal component with Filipa Lacerda. Filipa is a senior frontend engineer at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and works with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) daily. She wrote an [article](https://alligator.io/vuejs/vue-pagination-component/) recently on creating reusable components that you can use multiple times in your application without having to rewrite your code. She stresses the fact that components should be simple and not too complex, that way they can be more accessible and reusable in the future.
