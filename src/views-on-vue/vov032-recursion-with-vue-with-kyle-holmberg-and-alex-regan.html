<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guest:</b> </span><span class="s3">Kyle Holmberg &amp; Alex Regan</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks with two guests <a href="https://twitter.com/kylemh_"><span class="s4">Kyle</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexSashaRegan"><span class="s4">Alex</span></a> who work together in opensource. Kyle is a software engineer at<a href="https://www.autogravity.com"><span class="s4"> AutoGravity</span></a> interested in full-stack web development, graphic design, integrated systems, data visualizations, and soccer. Alex writes code and works with <a href="http://parametricstudios.com"><span class="s4">Parametric Studios</span></a>, and he also loves puppies. Check out today’s episode where the panel and the two guests talk about the different frameworks and contributing to opensource. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:03 – We got together because Alex mentioned his project. He was looking for something to get up running nice and easy. Boot Strap 4. That is a nice choice and I was contributing as a core team member at the time. He started with how do I get started with Boot Strap Vue. At the time I asked how do you do this...? And that’s how we got started.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:03 – Guest continues more with this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:30 – Chris: How did you start contributing within your company?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:44 – Guest: There is a lot of autonomy with the last company I was working with (3 people there). I needed more fine tooth hooks and modals. Someone says X and you try to figure it out. So I was looking at the transitions, and there was a bug there. They hadn’t implemented any hooks, and I thought I could figure this out. From there, if you want a change I can help out. I don’t know if that change got implemented first. I started contributing some things to the library. I really got involved where someone (the creator of the library said you could be a core member. He took a trust in me. I started a lot in test coverage. That might not be the normal path to take.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:39 – How long have you been developing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:42 – Guest: A year and a half. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:00 – Chris: Any tips to opensource for beginners.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:10 – Guest: Yes, having a thick skin. Everyone is anonymous on the Internet. People say things that they normally wouldn’t say in person. I figure if you put something out there someone will correct you. How can I get feedback? If you put yourself out there it’s like: failure to success. That process is what makes you better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:21 – Chris: Issues and chat like that. There is a lot of context that gets lost. When you just see the text it may seem angry</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:43 – Guest: I have a tendency towards sarcasm, and I have to save that to last. People come from different languages, and I’m not talking about software languages. English isn’t everyone’s first language. Good thing to keep in-mind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:14 – Internet is an international community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:22 – Guest continues this talk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Opensource is good to work on to get started with contributions. Especially with <a href="https://operationcode.org"><span class="s2">Operation Code</span></a> it’s geared towards beginners; less complex. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:30 – That is a good difference to show.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:01 – Question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:05 – Guest. If you are a person with a lot of skin in their projects – I take pride in my work – I think if you have that mentality that you will want to submit to every request. Find some way to test every request against a...is this my concern or their concern? Figure out the boundaries. You will make mistakes and that’s fine.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:54 – Panelist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:02 – Guest: Coming up with good interface boundaries for your libraries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:11 – Chuck: Once we figured out what really mattered than it makes it easier to say: <i>yes</i> or <i>no.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:26 - Guest: Conventional Commits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:06 – So Kyle what did you getting into opensource look like?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:19 – Alex: Boot Strap. Operation Code.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:07 – Chuck chimes-in about Aimee Knight and other people. Serving people and their country. You are helping people who have sacrificed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:58 – It is totally volunteer-based.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:05 – Chris: What kind of questions did you ask Alex? How did you decide what to put in an issue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:25 – Alex: I tend to go to Stack Overflow. If it is in regards to a library I go to GitHub. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Real time texts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Next.js – I just contributed to this this week. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:21 – Chris: This question is for either one of you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">For Questions and Answers – do you have any suggestions on what NOT to do when seeking help?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:46 – Stay away from only asking a question in one sentence. There is so much information/context that you are leaving out, and that can often lead to more questions. Reasonable amount of contexts can go a long way. Code samples. Please Google the details for the markdown if it is a huge code. Context, context, context!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:44 – I have an error, please fix it. Maybe that needs more context?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:53 – Guest: What were you doing? There is a bigger overarching element. The problem they can see in front of them and what is the thing that you are TRYING to solve? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:44 – More contexts that can help with a helpful answer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:53 – Guest: If someone used some learning tool...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:13 – Chuck chimes-in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck: It is something different that it could do something that you didn’t expect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:47 – Alex: Those are great moments. I love it when Kyle sees...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">That snowflake of your problem can help with documentation caveats.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:44 – People are probably copying pasting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:05 – It can be the difference between understanding the page and not especially </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">What not to do and what to do – any other tips?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Can you have too much information?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:32 – Guest: I am guilty of this sometimes. You can have too much information. The ability to converse in a real-time conversation is better. That’s my route to go. Maybe your problem is documented but documented poorly. Go to a real-time conversation to hash things out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:15 – Guest: If you do your homework with the different conversations: questions vs. concerns. Real-time conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">He talks about GitHub issues and Stack Overflow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:48 – Chuck: My password is 123...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">If they can duplicate...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Alex: Yeah too much information isn’t good. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Some places mandate recreation like a JS Fiddle. Like Sandbox are cool tools. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:32 – Is there a way to do the code wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:38 – Advertisement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:25 – Guest chimes-in with his answer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:31 – Question. If it’s opensource should they share?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:33 – Absolutely. The difference that makes it for me is great. I can spot things that the machine can help me find. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">One small tip is when you provide code samples and GitHub issues use...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The further you go out to recreate the problem there is a high payoff because they can get something working. The big difference is that it’s a huge pain to the person trying to convey the issue. If I do the simple version...I think you have to weigh your options. What tools are out there? Generate your data structure – there are costs to recreate the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:35 – Chris: 500 files, apps within the app – intercommunicating. All you do is download this, install this, it takes you ½ a day and how does this all work?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:03 – Guest: You have to rein it in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Provide the easiest environment for it to occur. If you are having someone download a table and import it, and use a whole stack – you can try it – but I would advise to work really hard to find...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:50 – In creating a demo keep it simple?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:52 – Guests reply.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:02 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:07 – Chris: I learned about your experiences coming to opensource. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Anything else that you would like to share with new contributors?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:25 – Guest: Start with something that you have a genuine interest in. Something like a curiosity light bulb is on. It makes it more interesting. It’s a nice way to give back. Something that interests you. I have not found a case yet that I’m not compelled to help someone. Putting yourself out there you might be given a plate you don’t know what to do with. My learning experience is how welcoming opensource is. Maybe things are changing? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:31 – Chuck: I have seen those communities but generally if they are there people frown down upon it. The newer opensource communities are very friendly. These projects are trying to gain adoptions, which is for the newer users. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:17 – Guest: Final statements on opensource. Even if you think it is a small contribution it still helps. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:55 – Guest chimes-in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It is important to have a platter for newcomers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:15 – Chris: I am curious to talk to you about how you’ve written React applications among others. Any advice? What resources should they </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:46 – Guest: Yeah. If you are making your new React application (from Vue land) there are many things that are similar and things that are different. As for preparing yourself, I am a huge fan of this one course. I had been coding (plus school) so 5 years, it’s okay to dive-into community courses. Dive-into a tutorial. Understand the huge core differences. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">He goes into those differences between React, Angular, and Vue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:30 – Guest talks about this, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:50 – React doesn’t have an official router. Vue provides (he likes <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s2">Vue’s</span></a> mentality) other things. There is a library called <a href="https://github.com/digitalie/one-loader"><span class="s2">One Loader.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">46:50 – Guest: I was at a <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s2">Meetup</span></a>. One guy was doing C-sharp and game development. His wife had a different background, and I think they were sampling Angular, Vue, and React - all these different frameworks. That was interesting to talk with them. I relayed to them that Vue has free tutorials. Jeffry had an awesome Vue Cast. I think that’s what got me started in Vue. I learned from this tool and so can you!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:11 – Chris: You aren’t starting from scratch if you know another framework? Do they translate well?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:33 – Guest: I think so. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">There are a lot of ways to translate those patterns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">49:34 – Guest: React Rally – I just went to one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">49:50 – Chris chimes-in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html">Slots</a></span><span class="s3"> is mentioned</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:27 – Guest mentions the different frameworks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Guest: I went into functional components in Vue. I learned about the way...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It helps you translate ideas. I don’t recommend it to everyone, but if you want to dig deep then it can help bridge the gap between one frameworks to another.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:24 – Chris adds to this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:36 – Guest: They are translatable. They are totally map-able.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:46 – Chuck: Say someone was going to be on a Summit where they could meet with the React Core Team. What things would you suggest with them – and say these things are working here and these are working there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"> 52:12 – Guest: I would love to see...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:03 – React doesn’t have a reactivity system you’d have to tell it more to...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:15 – Guest chimes-in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Panel and guests go back-and-forth with this topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:16 – Tooling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">55:38 – Guest: With React coming out with time slicing features how does that map to <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s2">Vue</span></a> and what can you say from one team to another. What is there to review? There is a lot of great things you can do with...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:44 – Conversation continues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:59 – React has some partial answers to that, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Progress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:10 – When Vue came onto the scene everyone felt like why do we need another framework? We have <a href="https://www.emberjs.com"><span class="s2">Ember</span></a>, and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">But with Vue it felt cohesive. It had an opportunity to learn from all the other frameworks. In terms of progress everyone is on the frontlines and learning from each other. Everyone has a different view on it. How can se learn from this and...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">59:12 – Chris: I am grateful for the different frameworks. Anyone comes out with a new tool then it’s the best. Creating something that is even better than before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">59:38 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">59:49 – Chuck: There are good frameworks out there why do I need another one. That’s the point. Someone will come along and say: I like what’s out there but I want to make...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">That’s what Vue was right? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">In some ways Vue was a leap forward and some ways it wasn’t – that’s how I feel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">We need something to make things a bit easier to save 10 hours a week.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:11 – Even <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s2">Vue’s...</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:02:20 – Guest: In terms of why do we need another framework conversation – I don’t think we need another reason. Go ahead, what if it is groundbreaking it makes everyone do things differently and keep up. I love the idea that<a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s2"> JavaScript</span></a> is saying: what is the new framework today? The tradeoff there is that there are so many different ways to do things. It is hard for beginners. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03:88 – Chuck: How to find you online?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03:49 – Kyle states his social media profiles, so does Alex, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:04:06 – Chuck: Let’s do some picks!</span></p>
