1:12 – Eric: You, Peter, write a really interesting article. How did you come to write that blog? Tell me about yourself.

1:29 – (_Peter talks about his blog and his current projects.)_

2:18 – Eric: Tell us about the blog!

2:25 – Peter: I talk about real-time synchronization and why you need it for data. You can use the websocket API and other applications.

3:29 – Panel: Let’s take a step back. It could be helpful to know: what _problem_ were you trying to solve with real-time data?

4:14 – Panel: So multiple client browsers? You are editing in one browser and the data is showing up in the other? You mentioned websockets and others – could you talk about WHY you didn’t go with the other ones?

4:45 – (_Peter answers the question._)

6:08 – Panel: So you created Hamoni Sync, and when did you start it?

6:20 – Peter: Yes, and I wrote it in March. I used real-time systems.

6:52 – Panel: What does it mean?

6:55 – (_Peter answers.)_

7:07 – Panel: Looks like it’s reasonably priced, too.

7:33 – Panel: Let me ask you this. How easy is it to get up and running using this on a Vue project?&nbsp;

7:45 – Peter.

8:34 – Panel: You have to install through your dashboard, then...

8:46 – Peter.

8:53 – Panel: You mentioned earlier that you shouldn’t websocket API right now?

9:04 – Peter:&nbsp; Not all users would have a browser that would support that.

9:39 – Panel: [Hamoni](https://www.hamoni.tech) handles all of that for you, which is nice. So it has a simple API to use. You started in March – is this your fulltime job...or?

10:08 – Peter: I started a new job 2 months ago, so now it’s part-time.

10:20 – Panel: You can use with any JavaScript library?

10:24 – Peter.

10:31 – Panel: Why did you do a tutorial in Vue and not in Angular or React?

10:37 – Peter: I do have one in React, and then...

10:54 – Panel: How do you like Vue so far?

10:55 – Peter.

11:15- Panel: The simplicity of Vue and you can take an older app and you can switch it over and not worry about jQuery and just go from there. Angular one days and instead of Angular 2+ or 6 now – Vue is an easy upgrade transition for sure.

11:47 – Peter.

11:51 – Panel: Walk us through how an app would work with this?

12:09 – Peter: When you connect you...

12:40 – Panel: What server is the data going to?

12:46 – Peter.

12:51 – Peter: I have a cloud service.

13:00 – Panel: How do they still get performance if there are a lot of people on at the same time?

13:06 – Peter.

13:17 – Panel: It handles all of the scaling?

13:23 – (_Panelist walks through the process._)

13:44 – Peter: No scaling issues, yet.

14:05 – Peter: I haven’t launched, yet, through [Product Hunt.](https://www.producthunt.com)

14:20 – Peter: The plan is to do that next month or middle of next month?

14:33 – Panel: Maybe once this podcast launches – that’s cool. What other apps can use real-time? Like a chat room is obvious when they are learning with socket IO. Is this beyond Vue?

15:07 – Peter: Yeah, in general it could be used for real-time chat applications and...

15:21 – Panel: Stock market updates?

15:28 – Peter: Yes. No, not animals.&nbsp; Maybe games for multi-player games. For chat room application.

18:45 – Panel: [Demopuppy.com](https://demopuppy.com/en/)

[19:11 – Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!](https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/)

20:00 – Peter: Related to the blog we have covered it well. Why you would use real-time and the different ways you can do it with websocket.

20:23 – Panel: You are in Nigeria?

20:24 – Peter: Yes.

20:27 – Panel: How is Vue.js in Nigeria – do you have [Meetups?](https://www.meetup.com)

20:44 – Peter: I think the tech scene is doing quite well. Mainly Angular and others use other frameworks.

22:08 – Panel: Conference and asking for people to contribute? (Yes.) That sounds great for an active community. Getting hard jobs in tech is hard but maybe hard in specific places.

22:39 – Peter: It is great the great one for React b/c of the popularity in React. React or Angular; one of the two.

23:12 – Panel: If you know your stuff you are good to go?

23:19 – Peter: Yes. [Microsoft’s .NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) is quite stable.

23:37 – Panel: You are starting a startup is that common in Nigeria?

23:49 – Peter: The startup is small actually.

24:37 – Panel: Are you in the capitol? (Yes.) There is a misconception there that people think you have to be in the California or bay area, and you can see that it’s not true. You can create cool things no matter where you are!

25:08 – Peter: It’s great to see the diversity.

25:14 – Panel: I think it’s cool what you are doing. I am glad you wrote an article. What is [HospitalRun?](http://hospitalrun.io)

25:42 – Peter: It’s a hospital management system to work offline first. To use them in remote areas where there is no connectivity.

27:08 – Panel: It’s an opensource project – [Hospital.io.](http://hospitalrun.io) You are more the maintainer of the frontend right?

28:05 – Peter: Yes.

28:11 – Panel: A lot of hospitals are using this and need contributors and if you want to have a real difference check it out. What do you do as the maintainer are you reviewing code requests?

28:40 – Peter.

28:56 – Panel: Ember.js?

29:00 – Peter: No, I am being dumped into Ember into the deep-end.

29:20 – Panel: I think we are going to go to our picks now? How can

29:30 – Peter: Twitter and email. Check out the show notes!

29:50 – Panel: Picks!
