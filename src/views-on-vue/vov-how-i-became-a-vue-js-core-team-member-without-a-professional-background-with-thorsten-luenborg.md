In this episode, the Views on Vue panel talks to Thorsten Luenborg about how he became a Vue.js core team member. Thorsten is a part of the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) core team, and has been for about 2 years. They talk about the beginnings of the creation of the Vue core team, what it means to be on the core team, and his main focus on the core team.
