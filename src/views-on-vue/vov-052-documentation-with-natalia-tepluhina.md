### **Episode Summary&nbsp;**

In this episode of Views on Vue, the panelists talk to Natalia Tepluhina, Senior Frontend Developer at GitLab, about the importance of good documentation and the value of its contribution to open source in comparison to that of actual code. Natalia talks about the projects she has written documentation for, and they discuss the challenges in producing good docs. She explains three rules in making documentation comprehensive and the process involved in its creation.&nbsp;

They then go into specifics about Vue documentation and discuss plugins, differences between cookbooks and guides, ways for developers to contribute to the projects, resources that they can use to learn stuff effectively and Vue Vixens curriculum vs official Vue documentation. Natalia gives an overview of Vue Vixens’ workshops (catered exclusively to women in software development) and mentions some locations around the world where they are held. She gives details about them including reasons why they choose to build mobile apps, their content and curriculum, and technical level of attendees. She also encourages women listeners to join their Slack channel (given in the links section) for more information about Vue Vixens. The panelists finally discuss representation of various groups in software development in general and the benefits of attending such workshops.
