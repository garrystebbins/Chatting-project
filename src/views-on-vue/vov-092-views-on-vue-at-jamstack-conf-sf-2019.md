In this episode of Views on Vue Charles Max Wood interviews speakers at JAMstack Conf SF His first interview is with Ire Aderinokun. Ire works for Buycoins, a cryptocurrency exchange for Africa. She gave a lightning talk, "Headless Chrome & Cloudinary for progressively enhanced dynamic content on the web". After giving a brief overview of her talk to Charles, Ire defines progressive enhancement for the listeners.

Walking through how progressive enhancement works, she explains how Headless Chrome and Cloudinary helped her with the project she shared in the talk. Ire and Charles consider the blindspot that developers experience because they work on high-end devices and how using progressive enhancement helps those who use lower-end devices.

Ire shares her experience with JAMstack and explains how progressive enhancement works with JAMstack. Charles shares his experience using JAMstack. The episode ends with Ire giving advice and resources to help get started with progressive enhancement.

Next, Charles interviews Shawn Erquhart work runs the Netlify CMS project. Charles share his experience using Netlify and Shawn address some of the issues Charles has come across. Charles does say the using Netlify is simple, clean and nice. Shawn shares the origin story of Netlify. They discuss what it means to be a git-based content management system.

They discuss how to contribute to the Netlify CMS open source project. Charles mentions his book and they discuss how contributions to open source projects like these are a great way to get a job. Shawn explains how to get started implementing Netlify CMS and how they target different static site generators.

Finally, Charles interviews Tammy Everts. Tammy gives listeners a sneak peek into her talk about website performance, more specifically JavaScript performance. Charles discusses the performance of Devchat.tv and Google Lighthouse scores. Tammy explains that while Google Lighthouse is good it isn't completely reliable and can miss chunks of time when your JavaScript is failing and you have unhappy users.

Tammy shares ways to drill down and see how your JavaScript is behaving in the wild. She talks about blocking Javascript which every developer is familiar with and non-blocking JavaScript that has high blocking CPU time which makes for janky sites. Tammy and Charles discuss what CPU is and what it measures. Tammy names resources and tools to help avoid this problem.

Rules of thumb for avoiding these issues are explained by Tammy. First, Reduce, make sure all the JavaScript needs to be there. Next, Monitor, track your metrics. She also suggests working with vendors and maintaining a performance budget for metrics that matter. The interview ends with a little about Speedcurve and what they do. Tammy is the CXO of Speedcurve.
