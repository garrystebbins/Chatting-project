### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of Views on Vue, the panelists talk to Sunil Sandhu, Full Stack Web Developer and the editor of _JavaScript in Plain English_. Sunil describes the projects he is currently working with, explains to listeners the comparison between Vue and Nuxt, the advantages in using Nuxt and what basic functionality and structure does it provide to developers by default. Divya speaks on some Nuxt customizations, and the frameworks she prefers in general apart from Nuxt.

In the end, they also talk about cases where Nuxt is not preferred.
