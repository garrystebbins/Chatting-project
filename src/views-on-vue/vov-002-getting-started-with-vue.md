In this episode of Views on Vue, the panelists discuss how they each got into [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and how you can go about learning [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) yourself. They really suggest utilizing the [Vue website](https://vuejs.org/) for tutorials and for help navigating the framework, especially in the beginning. They also discuss many great resources you can use to learn about this framework, especially if you are just starting out, and encourage you to look into them and get started on working with Vue!
