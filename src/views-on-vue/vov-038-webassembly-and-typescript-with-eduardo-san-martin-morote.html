<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:33 – Chris: Today’s panel is Joe Eames who organizes many different conferences. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:09 – Joe: That was long introduction! Hi everyone! I organize an Angular conference, too; it’s very small.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:26 – Chris: Divya is also on our panel and is an awesome speaker and conference organizer. Our special guest is Eduardo San Martin Morote! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:55 – Chris: Actually it’s good that I get your full name. I do speak a little bit of Spanish. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:17 – <i>Panel goes back-and-forth.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:33 – Guest: It was good and sounded like American Spanish. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:47 – Chris: This is about Eduardo and not my Spanish. You used to be a game developer?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:08 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:17 – Chris: You wrote a lot of <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s9">C++?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:20 – Guest: Yep!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:22 – Chris. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:50 – Guest: It’s optimized – you can handle 1 million requests per second – but that doesn’t happen unless it’s a huge organization. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:24 – Chris: Can you talk about <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s9">C++?</span></a> Compare it to <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s9">JavaScript?</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:37 – <i>Joe talks about transferring from JavaScript to </i><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s9"><i>C++.</i></span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:48 – Guest: I am an instructor, too, and teach <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s9">Vue.js</span></a> to people. The thing to me is the variable scoping of functions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:50 – Chris: Variable scoping – let’s not get into too much detail, cause we are an audio medium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:10 – Guest: When you look at the syntax and create classes with JavaScript...I think <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s9">C++</span></a> has always had classes from the beginning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:58 – Chris: I used to write things back in the day with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s9">C++.</span></a> I remember some features that were added later that I never got to take advantage of. I can’t remember what they were. I thought classes were one of those things. It won’t be a fruitful line of discussion cause I would be guessing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Chris: What’s different about <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com"><span class="s9">C++</span></a> is that the types are more important?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:57 – Guest: It’s not that it’s important it’s necessary. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:27 – Guest: Pointers are an integer that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:47 – <i>Guest continues.</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s6">8:52 – Chris: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%252B%252B_Programming/Memory_Management"><span class="s8">In C++ when you say memory management</span></a> you are...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:23 – <i>Guest talks about integers, JavaScript, memory, C++, and building games! Check out this discussion here!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:00 – <i>Panelist talks about web assembly and asks a question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:23 – Guest: You will always have...the thing is that you are always getting the most out of the hardware. Computers keep getting faster and faster and people are building games with more effects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:53 – (Guest continues): Native video games will always be a step ahead of what web assembly can achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:50 – Have you heard of <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor"><span class="s9">Blazor</span></a> (from Microsoft)? (No.) You write it all in C#. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Panel talks about Silver Light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:57 – Chris: What is different about web assembly compared to trans-piled to JS languages that are basically Ruby. That compile to JavaScript – you don’t have to write the JavaScript (it’s basically Ruby) and your browser will interpret the JavaScript. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:42 – Divya: Doesn’t it run on the GPU? That it runs on the graphic card?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:55 – Chris: It works at a very low-level. Take any language and have the same low access that languages do (low as safely as possible) in the browser b/c there is still security concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:27 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:43 – Chris: What if I am using Canvas?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:54 – Guest: ...the logic of your game will be faster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:20 – Chris: You have more fine-grained control? And you can control the speed of operations?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:25 – Guest: You should be able to. If you are using a program like C++...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:02 – Chris: I don’t know this...I know that JavaScript is an interpretive language you read it from top to bottom...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:25 – Panel: Can JavaScript read from top to bottom? I thought you had to see the entire thing? Correct me if I am wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:45 – Chris: Yeah, yeah – absolutely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:52 – Panel: I think that’s roughly accurate. We are way off topic!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:21 – Chris: Would it be accurate (since we aren’t all experts), but it sounds like web assembly is that it does work on a lower level than JavaScript, so it’s possible to achieve optimizations that wouldn’t be possible with JavaScript. Is that true?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:58 – Divya: I think you could say that...there is an <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/"><span class="s9">article by Lin Clark</span></a> that you should check out!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:37 – Panel: See link to show notes to find article and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/"><span class="s9">here!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:48 – Chris: What got you started into web development? Why no longer game development?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:02 – Guest: When I started coding at 13-14 years old. It’s funny b/c at 15 years old I was coding and I didn’t even know that I was doing it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:41 – Chris: Toxic like...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:50 – Guest: Before I was thinking of the long hours and people were working too much, and not getting the recognition that they deserve. It was toxic, and it was a diverse environment. I realized that diversity is very important. The field is changing, but that’s why. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:42 – Chris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:52 – Chris: Something else, it sounds like more familiar with C++ is <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"><span class="s9">TypeScript</span></a>. Talk about that please?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:17 – Guest: What got me into it were the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html"><span class="s9">generic types. </span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:30 – Chris: What is a generic?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:44 – <i>Guest talks about generics. He mentions integers and other terms. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:30 – <i>Panel helps to clarify about generics, too.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:08 – Panel: I got into generics when...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Panel: Did you get into generics around the same time as C++?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:27 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:00 – Panel: Where I see generics being used is with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/459647/rails-what-is-rjs"><span class="s9">RJS.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s6">28:33 <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s8">– Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:15 – Chris: What is the point?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:19 – Guest: I think there are many points of view with this. When I build my libraries...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:37 – Chris: You said that in VS code but I can get that in JavaScript. What is the extra advantage of using TypeScript on top of that? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:00 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:14 – Chris: Let’s say I ignore the auto-completion, I type quickly – would TypeScript give me a warning?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:31 – Guest: Yes that is true. If you use it with JavaScript you probably won’t have an error. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:05 – Chris: A compile time...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">You mentioned that you could enable some of these checks in JavaScript. How do you do that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Say you have an editor like VS Code, but can actually when there is a potential error?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:47 – Guest: For a project you have to create a...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:20 – <i>Chris asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:28 – Guest: Yes, I think it does. Pretty sure it does.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:37 – Chris and Guest go back-and-forth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:05 – Chris: See Show Notes for <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html"><span class="s9">TS Config.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:10 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:53 – Chris: If they choose not to use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"><span class="s9">TypeScript</span></a> what are the downsides?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:05 – Panel talks about his experience and why people might not use <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"><span class="s9">TypeScript</span></a>. He also mentioned <a href="https://coffeescript.org"><span class="s9">CoffeeScript</span></a>, <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/"><span class="s9">C#,</span></a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s9">JavaScript.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>He gives an analogy of riding a motorcycle and a truck. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:04 – <i>Panelist continues.</i> <i>He says that people love the freedom of </i><a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s9"><i>JavaScript.</i></span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:23 – Chris: If most of your bugs aren’t being caught by...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:00 – Panel: Something that looks and sees and fits super well doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea. A big project is totally different. When you dip your toe in the water it might be more overhead that you don’t’ need. You have to think about the smaller / larger cases. I think that’s why <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s9">Vue</span></a> is getting a lot of popularity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:15 – Chris: I don’t think I have found anyone coming from JavaScript that say that TypeScript is not worth it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:41 – Guest: I like TypeScript I don’t like writing applications in TypeScript. I like writing my libraries somewhere else. The flexibility that you have in JavaScript helps a lot. I don’t like my components to be typed. I do like having...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:27 – <i>Guest continues.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:35 – Chris: Why is it different bad or different good? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:40 – Guest: It’s bad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:53 – Chris: What hurts your development?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:00 – Guest: You get typing errors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest gives a specific example. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:11 – Chris: It sounds like with applications you are doing more proto typing and changing requirements. Making the types really strict and specific can really hurt you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:39 – Guest: That’s better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:44 – <i>Chris asks another question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:00 – Panel: That’s mostly true. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:13 – Chris: Types can make some refractors easier, but overall a lot of refractors are going to take longer with TypeScript. At least with your application - say it’s organized in both cases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:55 – Chris: One more thing about TypeScript – some people (if not coming from C# or C++) I have found that people are spending a lot of time (making sure the typing is working really well) rather than writing unit tests and stuff like that. There is an opportunity cost there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Try TypeScript – it might be for you!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:10 – Panel: As the team grows so do the benefits!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:20 – Chris: Anything else? Where can people find you? </span></p>
