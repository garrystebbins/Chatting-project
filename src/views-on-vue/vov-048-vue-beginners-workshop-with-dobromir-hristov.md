### **Episode Summary&nbsp;**
In this episode of Views on Vue, the panelists talk to Dobromir Hristov, a frontend developer from Bulgaria working for hypefactors. Dobromir is also the organizer of [VueJS Bulgaria](https://vuebulgaria.com/) and he created a Vue Beginners Workshop to increase the size of Vue community in Bulgaria. Dobromir describes the workshop’s development stage and his preparation process for the curriculum. He explains that for this workshop, they targeted developers with very little JavaScript experience. The workshop is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dobromir-hristov/vue-beginner-workshop) for people to check out and contribute. The panel then compares different workshop styles and best methods to keep the audience interested in the workshop content. Dobromir then gives details on the setup and concept of his workshop. He explains that he used Game of Thrones as the concept which the audience really enjoyed. He then describes what he would do differently next time. The panel talks about best practices and tips to prepare a good workshop and share anecdotes about their experiences addressing an audience in a workshop.
