The key to quickly learning JavaScript MV\* Frameworks is to break them down into a series of features. The main features of an MV\* application are routing, data binding, templates/views, models, and data access.

In this talk Iâ€™ll describe these features and show code examples from AngularJS, Backbone, and Ember for each feature.

You will begin to concretely understand what these frameworks are trying to help you accomplish and realize they are more alike than they are different. In fact, it becomes apparent that most of the frameworks borrow heavily from the successes of the others.
