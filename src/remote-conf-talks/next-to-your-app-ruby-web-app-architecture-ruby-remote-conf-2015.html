<p>Right next to your app is a world of software you probably don&#39;t think about: app servers, Rack interfaces, reverse proxies and load balancers. Starting right next to your app, we&#39;ll look at how Ruby web apps are built. Which pieces do you control as the developer? Which pieces are traditionally owned by ops? What do they do?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&#39;ll (quickly) talk about the standard software for these pieces -- Passenger, Puma, Unicorn, Thin, Rack, NGinX, Apache, HAProxy and Varnish, where they fit together, and why you might choose one or another.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the talk you&#39;ll know what you can put in your Gemfile to choose these, how production is different from development, and the beginning of how you&#39;d set this all up on your own if you needed to. You&#39;ll also know why you&#39;d have to choose one piece of software over another, versus when it&#39;s basically your call.</p>
