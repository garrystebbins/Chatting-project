He's also doing some interesting things at <a href="http://blog.peepcode.com">blog.peepcode.com</a>. Primarily, he's writing articles that each have their own themes. Go check it out!

Geoffrey mentions that he'll be speaking at <a href="http://schnitzelconf.com">SchnitzelConf</a> in Vienna, Austria. It's a conference about and for entrepreneurs.

It turns out the Geoffrey also created the <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff">Gruff library</a>. Geoffrey now does his graphs with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael</a>.
