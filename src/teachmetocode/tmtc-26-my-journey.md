[![](https://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg 'BuildingSkills-itunes')](https://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg)I've been thinking about the podcast and realized that I haven't told my story. So, I'm going to talk about how I got into programming and technology. It's a story that started early in my life and leads through my college years and into my career. I love programming and helping people and I would love to have more time to do that, but that means that I need to build a business that lets me do that. I'm not begging for money. But I would like your input. BTW- Sorry for the scraping noise. I didn't realize my mic was picking up my mouse scraping across the table.[Download this Episode](https://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC26_My_Journey.mp3)
