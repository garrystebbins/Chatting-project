Writing Code is the Easy Part is the new slogan for the website. It basically boils down to the fact that putting up syntacticly correct code is the simplest part of coding. More difficult is solving problems and all of the other things that come with having a job or working for clients. Here are some of the things that I listed as the harder parts of coding:

- Legacy Code
- Readability
- Testability
- Best Practices
- Writing Tests
- Team Dynamics
- Customer Communication
- Translating Behavior into Code
- Data Integrity
- Security
- Maintainability
- Systems Integration
- Server Technologies
- Databases
- Finding a Job
- Hiring and Firing
- Working on Boring stuff
- Job Fulfillment
