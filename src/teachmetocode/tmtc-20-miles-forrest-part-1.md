We had a terrific time talking about podcasting, work, life, and programming. One major theme that keeps coming up in my life and came up in this podcast was the discussion over doing what you love to do. I met Miles at RailsConf 2009 and at Mountain West RubyConf in March. We discussed doing an interview and in this episode, we wound up interviewing each other. I think my favorite part of the discussion was the explanation Miles gave of how he formed the Ruby Brigade in his local area. I'm not really sure how to summarize the content of this interview, so I'll just let you enjoy it.[Download this Episode](http://media.libsyn.com/media/charlesmaxwood/TMTC20_Miles_Forrest_Part_1.mp3)
