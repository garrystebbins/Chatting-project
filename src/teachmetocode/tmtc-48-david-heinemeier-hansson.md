[![](http://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg "BuildingSkills-itunes")](http://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg) This turned out to be a great interview with David Heinemeier Hansson. He's the creator of the Ruby on Rails web framework and a partner at 37 signals. We discussed what inspired him to build Ruby on Rails and work in Ruby. We talked about how 37 signals approaches things. We went into the Rails community and its ecosystem. A few things that were mentioned:
- [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)
- [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com)
On entrepreneurship, David tells us that building a company and concept has never been easier or cheaper. The barrier to entry is extremely low. You need more than programming power or business acumen to start a company. You need people who have an actual skill that will move the product or service forward.[Download this Episode](http://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC48DHH.mp3)
