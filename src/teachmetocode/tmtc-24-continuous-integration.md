[![](https://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg 'BuildingSkills-itunes')](https://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg)This is a discussion of the practice of Continuous Integration or Continuous Builds. Continuous Integration is a very important part of insuring that your code is of the highest quality. It runs tasks against your code that provide you information like whether your tests pass or your code compiles. The services I've used to do this are:

- [Hudson](https://hudson-ci.org/)
- [CruiseControl.rb](https://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/)
  You can use Continuous Integration to do the following:
- Catch failing tests
- Run and compare metrics
- Verify your development process
- Trigger deployments
