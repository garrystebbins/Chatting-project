[![](https://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg 'BuildingSkills-itunes')](https://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg)Michael Hartl put together a free rails tutorial online. We met at RubyConf and determined to talk about his tutorials. His path into Rails development has been interesting to listen to. Similarly, his thoughts on business are inspiring. We talked about a great way to support Teach Me To Code. And that is by purchasing his videos and book [here](https://zfer.us/LACK2). I don't usually promote products, but I think this one is a terrific one and I hate asking for money in return for nothing, so in this case you get some great videos and a book![Download this episode](https://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC45MichaelHartl.mp3)
