[powerpress] In the Pragmatic Programmer it talks about your knowledge portfolio and recommend that you invest in it regularly. In fact, it draws the analogy of a stock or financial investor and how they invest. I discuss my experience in investing and my thoughts on the content of the Pragmatic Programmers book. The only major difference or disagreement I have between their suggestions and my experience is that today most of the content you’d find in books or trade magazines is available online in blogs, videos, and other media. However, in some cases, the best documentation is in a recently written and maintained book. Here are some of the things I mentioned in the podcast:

- [Ruby Reloaded](https://rubyreloaded.com/) Peter Cooper’s Ruby Course
- [Teach Me To Code Academy - Ruby on Rails Course](https://teachmetocodeacademy.com)
- The [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=020161622X) ![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=020161622X&camp=217145&creative=399369) book
