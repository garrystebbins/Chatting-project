He's pretty well known as the Software Journeyman and his coding tours where he traded time pairing on code for room and board. You can keep up with him at [http://coreyhaines.com](http://coreyhaines.com). You can also check out the following links for other things he's doing:

Here's a link to the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) which is tied a lot to the discussion we had on Software Craftsmanship. Corey mentioned the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262510871?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262510871) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262510871) book, which is a mind-blowing set of instruction and exercises for computer programmers. We also discussed pairing in relation to the code retreats. Corey mentioned the paper by Arlo Belshee called ["Promiscuous Pairing and the Beginner's Mind"](http://mitchlacey.com/docs/XR4PromiscuousPairingandBeginnersMind.pdf)You can reach Corey on twitter as @coreyhaines and by email at coreyhaines@gmail.com Finally, checkout the latest news on the [XP Universe conference](http://twitter.com/xpuniverse2011).[Download this Episode](http://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC_33_-_Corey_Haines.mp3)
