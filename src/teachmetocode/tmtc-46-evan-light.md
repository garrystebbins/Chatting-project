 ![](http://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg "BuildingSkills-itunes")This week's podcast guest is Evan Light. I met Evan at the Ruby|Web Conference at Snowbird. He's responsible for [Coulda](https://github.com/elight/coulda) and the [Ruby DCamp](http://rubydcamp.org/). Evan recommended [Get Clients Now!(TM): A 28-Day Marketing Program for Professionals, Consultants, and Coaches](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814473741?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0814473741) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0814473741) (affiliate link) for marketing as a freelancer. We talked about organizing a conference and what it takes. He also had some great suggestions for people thinking about switching to freelance. I also found his discussion of why he wrote Coulda very interesting. It inspires me to think that if I want something different, I can create it. If you're looking for a way to increase readability of your code, look at [flog](http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html) or [metric\_fu](http://metric-fu.rubyforge.org/).[Jake Scruggs' talk at Lone Star Ruby Conference 2008](http://lsrc2008.confreaks.com/04-jake-scruggs-using-metrics-to-take-a-hard-look-at-your-code.html)Next month I'll be teaching a Basic Ruby on Rails course.
