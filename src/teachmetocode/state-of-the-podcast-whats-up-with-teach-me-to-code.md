[powerpress] I haven't done a podcast in about 3 weeks. I'm changing some things around and wanted to let you know what they were. For this podcast, I plan on foregoing my occasional rants on programming and do interviews every week. If you know someone who I should have on the podcast, then let me know. I'm going to change the format of the Screencasts as well. I'm going to move from a library demo meme to actually building web apps from start to finish. I think these tutorials are useful and insightful. It's also a little different from the other things out there. RailsRookies.com was launched last week. Right now it's a page listing the courses I'll be teaching over the next few months. If you're interested in those courses or something that isn't up there, then fill me in on what you want. I'd love to provide it for you. The Ruby on Rails Basics course starts next week. The newsletter is going to be published every other week. I'll try to share some insight from what I'm reading, studying and working on. I hope you enjoy it. I'm also trying to figure out who is interested in a Freelancing community centered around Ruby. If you'd like to be involved, contact me. Finally, I'm working on some new projects to try to supplement my consulting income. One of them involves Boy Scouts. The other involves online Pay Per Click marketing.
