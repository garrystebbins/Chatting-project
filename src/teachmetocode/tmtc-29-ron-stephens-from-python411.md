[![](http://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg 'BuildingSkills-itunes')](http://teachmetocode.com/podcast/files/2010/08/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg)Ron Stephens has been programming python as a hobbyist for the last 10 years. He's a technologist, hobbyist, poet, and manager at a firm that makes hardware for satellites. He is the host of the [python411 podcast](http://www.awaretek.com/blog/) and the [awaretek podcast](http://www.learnoutloud.com/Podcast-Directory/Philosophy//AwareTek-Podcast/6860). He has tried many different languages including Perl, Ruby, Java, and Python. During his exploration of programming languages, he has read and recommends:

- The Pickaxe Book - [Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974514055?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0974514055) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0974514055)
- The Camel Book - [Programming Perl (3rd Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596000278?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596000278) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596000278)
- A book called something like 'Hacker Revolutionaries.' I can't find it. Could someone give a link if you know where to get it?
  When asked about what philosophies, approaches, and principles python developers adhere to he mentioned the [Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). We discussed podcasting and education. If you're looking for Grammar Girl, click [here](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/). If you want some python tutorials, check out [Ron's Tutorial page](http://www.awaretek.com/tutorials.html). For new developers, Ron recommends:
- [Show-me-do](http://showmedo.com)
- [Python news group](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python)
  For advanced developers, Ron recommends:
- [Reading Python Books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpython%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) ![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=ur2&o=1)
