[powerpress] Tom Preston-Werner is one of the founders of Github.com. He's a Ruby programmer who has successfully launched a business used by hundreds of thousands of programmers all over the world to host their programming projects. He is also the original developer behind Gravatar. We discussed how [Github.com](http://github.com) got started. Tom also mentioned [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com), [god](http://god.rubyforge.org), and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). We also discussed open source software, contributing, hiring developers, and what makes Github such a great place to work. If you want some good pointers about how things should work at a development shop, I recommend this episode.<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wn1zx_HB-LU" width="560" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
