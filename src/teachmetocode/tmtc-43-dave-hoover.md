He's the Chief Craftsman at [Obtiva](https://obtiva.com). He's also written [Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596518382?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596518382) ![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596518382) The most exciting part, was learning about apprenticeship from the guy who wrote the book. Dave got started by reading [Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201733862?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201733862) ![](https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201733862). He also mentioned a few people that he considered masters:

- [Fred George](https://processpeoplepods.blogspot.com/)
- [Uncle Bob Martin](https://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html)
- Corey Haines
  There's some great advice on figure out where you are and determining where you can get to and how.
