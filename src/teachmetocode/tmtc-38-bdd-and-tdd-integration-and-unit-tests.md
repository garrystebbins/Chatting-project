In this podcast episode, I discuss writing unit tests vs integration tests and why you need both. Here's the link to [Ben Mabey's talk on Cucumber](https://confreaks.net/videos/72-mwrc2009-bdd-with-cucumber). You can also find out more about Cucumber in the [Screencasts](https://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/introduction-to-outside-in-development-with-cucumber/) and at [cukes.info](https://cukes.info)[Download this Episode](https://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC38IntegrationAndUnitTesting.mp3)
