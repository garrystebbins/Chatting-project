[powerpress] You can get the video version of this podcast [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJwsyr2Webc&feature=youtube_gdata_player). David Heinemeier Hansson sparked a debate on Twitter about Ruby testing frameworks. A lot of people saw it as slamming RSpec and others saw it as constructive conversation about what tools you use and why. This is how I view to see it and where I come down on this debate. I also discuss why we have these debates in general and what we can learn from them.
