[Download this episode](http://media.libsyn.com/media/charlesmaxwood/003_Finding_a_Mentor.mp3)One of the things that has helped me the most in learning to program well is having a good mentor. I didn't necessarily choose mine, but I've had some excellent mentors. Here's what made them great for me.<!--more-->
1. They had been where I was at.
2. They were at where I wanted to be.
What they did that was so powerful.
1. They explained topics and details when I needed to apply them.
2. They didn't solve my problems for me.
3. They encouraged me to explore the areas I needed to learn about.
4. They provided structure for the environment I was learning in.
5. They provided an example of where I wanted to be.
