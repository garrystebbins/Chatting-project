I didn't necessarily choose mine, but I've had some excellent mentors. Here's what made them great for me.<!--more-->

1. They had been where I was at.
2. They were at where I wanted to be.
   What they did that was so powerful.
3. They explained topics and details when I needed to apply them.
4. They didn't solve my problems for me.
5. They encouraged me to explore the areas I needed to learn about.
6. They provided structure for the environment I was learning in.
7. They provided an example of where I wanted to be.
