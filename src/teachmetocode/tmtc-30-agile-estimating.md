You can estimate on the following scales:

- T-shirt sizes
- Fibonacci Numbers
- Algorithmic/Exponential scale
- Linear scale
  You can estimate in several units of measurement as well:
- Points (Complexity)
- Hours
- Days
- T-shirt sizes
  Overall, estimation can help you inform timelines, identify problems in features or your development cycle, and open discussion on tough features. [Download this Episode](https://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC_30_-_Agile_Estimations.mp3)
