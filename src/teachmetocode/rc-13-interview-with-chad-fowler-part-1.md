[![](http://localhost/~charleswood/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg)](http://localhost/~charleswood/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/BuildingSkills-itunes.jpg)This week I interviewed Chad Fowler. He and several others have helped organize Ruby conferences around the world, most notably [RailsConf](http://railsconf.org), RubyConf, and RubyConf India. He has also written [The Passionate Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356344?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356344) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1934356344) and [Rails Recipes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977616606?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0977616606) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0977616606). Finally, he has contributed to open source projects like [RubyGems](http://docs.rubygems.org) and [Facebooker](http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/).<!--more-->You can follow Chad at [his website](http://chadfowler.com) or [on twitter](http://twitter.com/chadfowler). Chad is an organizer at [Ruby Central](http://rubycentral.org) which is a non-profit which provides support to the Ruby community. Among other things, they provide a [Regional Conference Grant](http://static.rubycentral.org/rcg2006.pdf) which local conferences like [Mountain West RubyConf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org) can take advantage of. He told me a bit about his inspiration for writing The Passionate Programmer and his experience working in India. The Passionate Programmer is about fulfillment in programming and work. It lays out a methodology for managing your career. We discuss the paths that a career can take and things that people should consider as they move through their career. One example he gives is from the book [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307389839?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307389839) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0307389839). He talks about what we do when we have to do it to succeed, versus what we do when "success" comes naturally. Overall, there was a lot of great information in the interview. I'd like to thank Chad for coming onto the show and for all of his hard work in the Ruby and Rails communities.[Download this Episode](http://media.libsyn.com/media/charlesmaxwood/RC_13_Chad_Fowler_Part_1.mp3)
