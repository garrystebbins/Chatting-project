[powerpress] Every programmer should find opportunities to learn something new. Why?

- It causes you to confront new problems.
- It increases your ability to solve problems.
- It expands your skill sets/profitability/versatility.
- It keeps your mind sharp.
  How?
- Jump in
- Take a course
- Find a Mentor
- Read a Book
- Search the Web
- Read the Code
  Reasons why I sometimes fail at this:
- Time
- Family
- Clients
- Projects
- Podcasts
- Money
  Solutions:
- Spend 1 hour per day on learning new technologies.
- Leverage my time better.
- Set a schedule.
