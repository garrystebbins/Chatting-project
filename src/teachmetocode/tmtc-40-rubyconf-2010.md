Thank you guys so much for helping me make it to RubyConf this year. It was a great experience. I was exposed to a lot of new technologies that I'm anxious to help you figure out. I'd heard about some of these, but here is a list of some of them:

- mustache.js
- gdb
- memprof
- Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby 2.0
- Rite (Ruby Lite) which was announced as an embedded systems version of Ruby
- Metric Fu Hotspots
- Citrus
  I also ran into some familiar voices (from interviews) and new voices (that will be interviewed) including:
- David Heinemeier Hansson
- Yehuda Katz
- James Edward Gray II
- Wayne Seguin
- Michael Hartl
- Chad Fowler
- Dave Thomas
  Finally, I'd like to thank the handful of people who came up to me and told me how much they enjoy the podcast and screencast. It's great to talk to you guys. You inspire me to do better.[Download this Episode](https://traffic.libsyn.com/charlesmaxwood/TMTC40RubyConf2010.mp3)
