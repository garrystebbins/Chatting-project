Geoffrey Grosenbach well known for his screencasts at [Peepcode.com](http://peepcode.com) as well as the [Ruby on Rails podcast](http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/) and [Nuby on Rails](http://nubyonrails.com). He's also doing some interesting things at [blog.peepcode.com](http://blog.peepcode.com). Primarily, he's writing articles that each have their own themes. Go check it out! Geoffrey mentions that he'll be speaking at [SchnitzelConf](http://schnitzelconf.com) in Vienna, Austria. It's a conference about and for entrepreneurs. It turns out the Geoffrey also created the [Gruff library](http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff). Geoffrey now does his graphs with [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/). I also brought up [http://roughunderbelly.com](http://roughunderbelly.com) which is a task manager. It's pretty simple and was an experiment with AJAX and RJS.
