[Download this Episode](https://media.libsyn.com/media/charlesmaxwood/railscoach004.mp3)This week I talked to Ben Johnson, who built the [authlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) and [memorylogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/memorylogic) (among many other) libraries for the Ruby and Rails communities. He talked to me about the side business he's running, what he looks for in developers who come work for him, and about being a passionate programmer. If you want to keep up with him and what he's doing, you can check out [his blog](https://binarylogic.com) or [his github profile](https://github.com/binarylogic). He also said that he'll be at [RailsConf](https://railsconf.org) this year in Baltimore.
