##### **Episode Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;** 
In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panelists talk with Kevin Kreuzer on source maps. Kevin is a freelance Software Engineer from Switzerland and currently is a part of the frontend architectural team for a company called Schaltstelle. He also regularly writes blog posts on Angular topics, contributes to opensource projects and is the co-founder of a startup – Trasier.
