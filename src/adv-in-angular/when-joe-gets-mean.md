## **When Joe Gets MEAN**

On today’s episode, Charles Max Wood, Alyssa Nicoll, Joe Eames, and Ward Bell talk about Joe's experience in building&nbsp;an application with MEAN.&nbsp;Tune in to learn about this JavaScript framework, and hear what happens **when Joe gets MEAN**.

## **Why did Joe choose MEAN?**

[MEAN](https://mean.io/) stands for Mongo Express Angular and Node. Joe wanted&nbsp;to use familiar tools for his production project. He didn't want to use anything heavy on his server. In the process, he considered other options including Firebase. He chose Mongo since he only needed to make simple Rest calls. Any Rest API will be fine to access it. Joe wanted to build a small application. Any SQL would have worked, but he needed something that could enable a quick push.

## **An Easy Model for a Small App**

The data model is relatively simple. Databases would usually have 3 tables. But for the app he's building,&nbsp;he ended up having 5 tables to make it easy to query. One of the core elements has 10 attributes, while the others have three. It can also cater to&nbsp;different kinds of queries. In Joe's app, users primarily can&nbsp;go to the central page and pull a list of articles.

## **Experience with MEAN**

Joe had enough experience with MEAN stack. He's written few medium-sized applications. He is definitely comfortable with it. It became more comfortable since he worked with two courses, Firebase and Angular Fire. For that, he worked with Firebase teams. He discusses&nbsp;the challenge in understanding how to model data.To hear more about Joe's experience&nbsp;building an application&nbsp;with MEAN,&nbsp;download and listen to the entire episode _When Joe Gets Mean_,.If you’re short on time, here are the highlights of When Joe Gets Mean:Why did Joe choose MEAN?
