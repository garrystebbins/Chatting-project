 **Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Alyssa Nicoll
- Ward Bell
- John Papa
- **Special Guests:** Brittany Moore

In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel talks to Brittany Moore about her unique experience into [Angular](https://angular.io/). Brittany has been working as a front-end developer for about four years and is currently a consultant for [Test Double](https://testdouble.com/). She was first introduced to Angular at a talk that John Papa gave and was blown away by the sheer power of it. She really encourages people who are learning Angular to get out and attend talks, conferences and meetups so that they can build connections and get more information from people who are good at what they do.
