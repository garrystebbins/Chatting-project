<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guests:</b></span><span class="s2"> <a href="https://medium.com/bratislava-angular"><span class="s3">Martin Jakubik</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In this episode, the Adventures in Angular panel talk with <a href="https://medium.com/bratislava-angular"><span class="s3">Martin Jakubik</span></a> and he has been working with Angular for the last three years. He has one large and one small Angular application, which the panel talks about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:31 – Alyssa likes to be called...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:40 – Alyssa: You have a large and small application – what makes it small? Is it the user-base? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:56 – Martin: It is one module out of ten or twenty components. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2: 59 – Panelist: Only 1 Angular module?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:47 – Panelist: Joe went off on how much he hates modules. I am sorry JP we had to throw that in that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:04 – Joe: I am an anti-modulist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:11 – Martin: Just one module.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:21 – Panelist: When you are building an application with one module – start us from the beginning, what does it look like?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:38 – Martin: It is actually quite special. It has to run in an iFrame, and all it does it allows the user to add into the experiment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:05 – Alyssa: Is it like a CMS?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:10 – Martin: It is like Google Optimize. The application is quite simple and every component is in that one module.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:36 – Panelist: How many do you have? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:44 – Martin: There are less than 10 services and 20 components at most.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:57 – Panelist: I feel personally, I feel like that I a decent size?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:11 – Panelist: That makes perfect sense. If there is no routing or nothing...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:40 – Panelist: Asks a question, and clarifies the question to Martin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:48 – Panelist: It is nice and clean.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:55 – Panelist: I do, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:08 – Alyssa: How new is it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:15 – Panelist: June/July?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:32 – Martin: I am using the new style. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:01 – Panelist: I am leery of using it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:13 - Panelist: I would like to clarify. When you mention you have 20 components...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:40 - Panelist: Do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:34 – Panelist: Webpack. Can you explain what that is and how you solved it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:57 – Martin: I don’t think I did anything special. I wanted to know how it works. I used webpack and used their configurations. Several months into the project then I...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:40 – Panelist: Why did you decide not to use the CLI? This is like an Iron Man thing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:55 – Panelist: I think it’s a pain thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:05 – Martin: I wanted to know how it works. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:32 – Martin: I started from scratch, I can’t remember.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:44 – Panelist: Whenever I use webpack it makes my head spin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:56 – Martin: The application was very simple. I was doing more blogging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:45 – Panelist: It is doing more configurations on the fly for you. It’s wonderful if it works and if it doesn’t work then I don’t know what you’d do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:17 – Martin: That’s why I did it, so I can appreciate all the magic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:30 – Panelist: How big is big?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:36 – Martin: Enterprise level. 100 different components. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:06 – Panelist chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:13 – Panelist: That is complex. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:28 – Panelist: let’s add more modules to add to the complexity...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:55 – Alyssa: When you took your app to the CLI was that hard?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:06 – Martin: That took me one whole day. The module is so simple that’s why. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:32 – Panelist talks about this topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:39 – Panelist asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:53 – Panelist: Fixing any problem ... ever work on tooling help people if they have their stuff in the right file name?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:18 – Martin: I used <a href="https://www.cypress.io"><span class="s3">Cypress.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:58 – Panelist: Under what situation would you recommend it to anyone? Do it your own webpack configuration?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:23 – Martin: Only if...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:51 – Alyssa: What if you wanted to add a watermark to each file, do you have to stop adding the CLI?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:13 – Panelist: So am I...what are the boundaries, I don’t know what they are? I’m curious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:41 – Panelist: Are you asking, Alyssa, how you would customize it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:09 – Panelist: You won’t loose all the features that you get. You now elected out of that place where they had it; webpack configurations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:12 – Panelist: What happened to it ejecting? How do you get it out of there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:26 – Good question! I have – I like to play with scissors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">22:43 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s3">Advertisement</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:32 – Panelist reads a message from the company. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">How do you get that voice?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:10 – First you have to have a really deep sinus cold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:00 – Panelist: Do you live without eject? I really don’t care. What I care about...Scratch that! I want to know what kinds of things you can’t do with a CLI that would drive you to do your own application? What other things could you not do in webpack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:50 – Martin: I wanted to see how it works.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:56 – Panelist: Now I use CLI and all it’s features except testing. I use Cypress completely separate than CLI.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:46 – Panelist: I feel like it’s talking to the one person without a cellphone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:01 – Panelist: Wow! I had no concept that life could be like that! I thought you had to have a cellphone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:29<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>– Martin: What does anyone use the CLI for anyways?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:44 – Martin: I use it for unit tests.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:52 – Panelist: Another question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:30 – Alyssa: You write things out by hand because it’s easier?!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:44 – Panelist: You copy, and paste and it’s less work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:06 – Panelist: It feels easier. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:22 – Joe: No, I am serious. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:48 – Joe: Yes, I am amazing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:30 – Martin talks about another topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:48 – Alyssa: When you generate a component do you put it into a different file?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:29 – Panel: We are all friends here and we aren’t shaming anyone here. We are joking here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:00 – Alyssa: It’s that he can write it from memory. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:08 – Panelist: I have been using <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s3">Vue</span></a> lately. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">He also talks about Angular and mentions <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s3">Sarah Drasner</span></a>, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:26 – Panelist: Not everyone has a memory like him, though.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:32 – Panelist: The fourth version of <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer"><span class="s3">Renderer</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:28 – Panelist: We are not talking about Nirvana the band, here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:46 – Alyssa: It will be the new Renderer. It’s out for you to try. Check out Angular Air. He was trying out IB yourself right now. People are flipping out about it. I am excited to see how my Angular app runs differently now. Here is the code that was generated, here is the code that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I am not sure that there is a promise date. Any secrets heads-up on when it will come out?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:22 – Panelist: The big question what does this mean for my existing code? Do I have to change my existing code?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:48 – Alyssa: The Angular team is working so that there are minimal changes. I don’t have a good answer. NGGC. For third-party libraries you run it through and it...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I don’t know what that means for the community. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:49 – Panelist: My hope is that they...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:03 – Alyssa: For your third-party...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:18 – Panelist: Question: between your small and large pack? What architectural differences are there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:44 – Martin: I have a template edit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:03 – Panelist: Come to my...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:32 – Panel talks about talks that Jon can do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:13 – Panelist: True story...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The panel is having fun going back and forth with jokes.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:03 – Panelist: This kind of stuff creeps into production code. That’s the great thing about copy and paste.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:21 – Panelist: We had a rule, though, if it happens more than once let’s put into our build. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:20 – It’s 3 hours if you have a CI process, if you don’t...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:33 – Console.log</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:49 – Martin chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:14 – Panelist: Let’s talk about an iFrame in your app?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:27 – Martin: The point is to be able to do it with any...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Make sure that it doesn’t collide. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The CSS wasn’t separated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I had to put my application inside an iFrame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:27 – Panelist: Thanks for coming on for us, Martin.</span></p>
