<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guests:</b></span><span class="s2"> Ilya Bodrov &amp; Roman Kutanov</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In this episode, the Adventures in Angular panel talks with Ilya and Roman. Ilya is a professor, writer, and developer. Roman is a cofounder, and a CEO, of a small startup company. Roman is making an application for small businesses, and he also was a CEO of a Russian startup, too. Check-out today’s episode where the panel talks to the guests about Angular, their startup companies, Test Cafe, among others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:20 – Guests’ backgrounds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:31 – Chuck: Let’s talk about Angular. In your opinion why is it a good option for startups?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:55 – Guest: Angular is a very good choice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:55 – Guest: If you are not familiar with these concepts or a seasoned developer then it can be difficult and complex to get started. It really depends on what you are trying to build.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:47 – Chuck: Once you get rolling with it then you run into limitations with it. If you need something simple and fast it’s really nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:08 – Guest: Yes. Trying to find your market niche. Angular is very simple to transfer. Angular has a great community. There are some problems, and we know it. Like the whole mess with versions also...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:27 – John: Can you elaborate a little?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:34 – Guest: Yes, if you want to be in the latest technologies...so sometimes you get into a situation when you wan to have some libraries installed and you cannot do that. If you are on one version and this one isn’t supported, then it was a huge mess. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:43 – Guest adds in more comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:26 – Guest: Currently I have Angular 1. It is too complicated to rewrite. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:40 – Guest adds comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:57 – John: There would have to be a compelling reason for me to go to Angular 6 at this point. Going from 4 to 5 or 5 to 6 – the one feature – boy that is so amazing. To have it to update your app, and update your code then that’s awesome. If you didn’t know that a command changed then you were in trouble. I agree version control has always been a challenge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:20 – Guest: What I like about Angular is the community – it drives it in the right direction. They try to make it more productive and that’s what I like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:43 – Chuck: What is it like to run a startup?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:56 – Guest: I started to write the application. What you see is what you get. I use Angular 1. <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s3">JavaScript</span></a> is a heavier language. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:54 – Guest adds comments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:02 – Panelist: What kind of server are you using for your startup?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:19 – Guest: I have Angular 1 as a backhand. The main application right now is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:11 – Panelist: What has the experience been like for people?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:26 – Guest: Yes...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:32 – Panelist: What were the benefits of using <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s3">Angular</span></a>? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:40 – Guest: Angular was very helpful. The performance is much better. Important for startups is to know how to write functionality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:53 – Panelist: What forms were you using?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:01 – Guest: Template driven. In Angular 1, I created “what you see is what you get.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:52 – Panelist: I am torn about forms. The Reactive side but you move a lot of code that doesn’t feel all that intuitive to me. There are pros and cons of each, but it’s not exactly where I want it to be. I would love to mix the 2 together. Have you dealt with validation in the forms?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">21:04 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s3">Digital Ocean’s Advertisement.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:41 – Guest: I have an editor. I send it to the client. Each input is having some sort of validation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:17 – Panelist: How do you make them look good? Yeah, I can do it but how does it not look generic? Do you have a layout?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:53 – Guest: I throw it into the screen – I try to keep it simple. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:04 – Panelist: That makes sense. I didn’t know if there was a crossover of complexity. I want a balance between...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:38 – Panelist: Reactive or Template driven?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:45 – Guest makes comments. You want to have some custom checking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:13 – Panelist: Why was it hard?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:21 – Guest: Not sure...I experimented a lot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:27 – Panelist: I gave up on Reactive. One of the killers for me was the nested components. It seemed to fall apart in my hands. It was extremely difficult. The outer form lost contact to what was going on. That was one of the biggest decisions to walk away from Reactive all together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:25 – Guest: Now I remember why I dropped templates. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:44 – Panelist: Not true, but it’s doable! It’s also easy! You have to know what’s going on. Let’s change the story on this – I don’t want to hijack the podcast. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:55 – Panelist: It makes your ears stand up. John’s objection was that he was putting a lot of stuff into HTML. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:43 – Panelist: Every time I see some try to decorate the HTLM – no you don’t have to do that. The rules aren’t there. There are exceptions, of course, but real validation is not screen validation. Interestingly, we have written one for this application. It belongs to Marcel. This isn’t Breeze specific – maybe we an get people to working on it. For sure, even if you didn’t have this framework, you can create one on your own. It turns out that it has more models than you think it does. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:55 – Panelist: Aside from forms, what mattered in your app?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:22 – Guest answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:01 – Panelist: Lazy Loading. In some apps lazy loading doesn’t make sense in all areas. You don’t always have to use. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:53 – Guest: Yes, when you work for your employer you sometimes have more time available. When you have a startup it’s a race. Your startup doesn’t have any money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:24 – Panelist: You had money?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:33 – Guest: You have to try new things and makes things right. When users really start really using your application. You can fix everything and make the perfect app or you can learn new things about your users. What problems do that have? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:50 – Panelist: Question asked. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:40 – Guest answers question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:38 – Protractor. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:51 – Problems that you/we ran into. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:21 – Panelist: “We” are using <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe"><span class="s3">Test Cafe. </span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:58 – <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress"><span class="s3">Cypress.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:10 – You do not need web driver and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:29 – <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe"><span class="s3">Test Cafe</span></a><b> </b>is free. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:39 – I would pay ten’s of dollars to use a piece of software. It’s a budget buster. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:15 – Sounds like you guys have a great product there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:24 – Thanks for having us.</span></p>
