**Special Guests:**

In this episode, the Adventures in Angular panel talks to Ben Lesh, Tracy Lee, and Jay Phelps about RxJS. Tracey is the co-founder of [This Dot Labs](https://www.thisdot.co/labs), which does a lot for the [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) community and does JavaScript consulting, as well as is on the [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) core team. Jay is also a co-founder of This Dot Labs and used to be on the RxJS core team. Finally, Ben is an engineer at Google, is the RxJS project lead there, and is on the [Angular](https://angular.io/) team. They talk about the changes to RxJS from the past year, the API changes for version 6, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**

- Ben, Tracey, and Jay intros
- What happened in the last year with RxJS?
- No longer a test scheduler
- Using real timers
- Version 5 VS version 6
- [TestScheduler.Run method](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/marble-testing.md)
- Won’t have to write code with injecting a scheduler
- What’s the best way to get started?
- Look at the docs
- Understanding Marble diagrams
- Many blog articles on Marble syntax out there
- Wasn’t originally designed for public consumption
- Using the test Scheduler is not a requirement for testing RxJS code
- [Jasmine testing framework](https://github.com/shairez/jasmine)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- Marbles diagrams are a bit more declarative and specific to RxJS
- Is it a part of RxJS proper?
- API changes for version 6
- Backwards compatibility package
- TSLint rules
- [rxjs-tslint](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs-tslint)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- And much, much more!
