**Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Tomek Sułkowski

In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists discuss UX in Angular with Tomek Sułkowski. Tomek currently works as a front-end engineer for an app creating company, as well as has been working for [Sages](http://sages.io/) running front-end workshops that mostly have to do with [Angular](https://angular.io/). They talk about his [blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/angular-techniques-improve-submit-buttons-ux-by-not-disabling-it-896992a94a38), buttons, and improving the user experience. They also touch on the importance of using simple solutions rather than overcomplicated ones, how to teach UI in training, and much more!
