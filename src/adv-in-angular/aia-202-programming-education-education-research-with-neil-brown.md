**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Shai Reznik
- Ward Bell
  **Special Guests:** Neil Brown

In this episode, the Adventures in Angular panel talks to Neil Brown about learning to code and learning to code better. Neil works as a research fellow at Kings College in London where he works in computing education. He is very interested in how people learn to program and also making tools that make learning to program easier. They talk about things that experts can do to help new people pick up programming easier, how you can use live programming to teach novices, and the importance of having a supportive community. They also touch on what he has learned from his research, the necessity of practice over time, and more!

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
