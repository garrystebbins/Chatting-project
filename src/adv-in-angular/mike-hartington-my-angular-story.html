<h2>My Angular Story Mike Hartington</h2>
Mike is an Ionic Developer Advocate. He's been a guest in Adventures in Angular (Episode 64 and 109) and Java Script Jabber, and he spoke in Angular Remote Conference. Tune in to <strong>My Angular Story Mike Hartington</strong> to know more about how he started in programming.
<h2>The Beginning of Mike's Programming Journey</h2>
His first dive in programming was simply out of necessity. He took Intro to Computer Science in high school where he did visual basic. He really didn't think of pushing it through college, and he was into craft design courses instead.

When he had his last semester course on web design, that was the first time he went back into programming and web technology after high school. He fell in love with Flash before JavaScript. He found it to be so awesome because it's interactive and it's so much fun.

When he got out of school, he did marketing and design at a company. One of the requirements were to do interactive product demos and create resources for sales team. They were provided with iPads to do the task, but Flash doesn't run in iPads. Being the case, he had to relearn JavaScript.
<h2>The Drive to do Programming</h2>
When he got hired in a company as a designer working with developers, he initially that it would look great. But eventually he didn't want to do the job because it would take him forever. He also had this boss who was very much of a visual person.

When he showed him something in the computer, he was asked about how that particular thing would work. Not having Sketch back then, he didn't have the newer UI mockup tools. He recoded all the interactions, and his boss was pleased.
<h2>Design's Influence on Programming</h2>
Being a designer before has somewhat been an influence to Mike's life as a programmer. He helps other developers handle issues and figure better solutions just like how a designer would do.

The main goal of designing is producing an output that appears as if it's done the only way it should. In the end, the product would seem to a natural fit.

Charles agrees with Mike's idea in how to solve a problem. Using API for instance, Mike doesn't want to think over about how to use it. He wants to keep things simple. The API should be materialized the way it should have been done.
