### **Summary**
Chaz Gatian joins the show to discuss his blog post, “10 Lessons Learned in Enterprise Angular Development”. He starts by defining enterprise and the panel dives into the first point of his blog post about not making boneheaded mistakes. Next, the panel discusses utilizing view components and compare the ways they organize their code. Which touches on a couple more points, bubbling your components and packaging only if you are going to share. Alyssa Nichol asks Chaz about teams developing a fun application and breaking out of the research loop.
