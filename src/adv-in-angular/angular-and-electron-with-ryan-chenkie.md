## Angular and Electron with Ryan Chenkie

On today's episode, Adventures in Angular features **Angular and Electron with Ryan Chenkie**. Ryan is a product owner, blogger, and JavaScript trainer. His interests in working on Angular with other technologies led him to using it on&nbsp;desktop apps&nbsp;with Electron. Tune in! &nbsp;&nbsp;

## Working with&nbsp;Angular and Electron

It started with Ryan's interest in working on Angular with other technologies. He once dabbled with&nbsp;Ionic, but eventually changed to Electron. He thought it would be a good try. That inspired him to write a blog about it. He focused on marketing content, but also explored how Angular and Electron can be brought together.

## Difference with Angular

According to Ryan, you can layer up an Electron app with Vanilla on the fronted. It's easy to set. One example is&nbsp;setting up a JavaScript app while working with a browser. Things are a bit different with Angular. You need to arrange the CLI projects to make it run on&nbsp;Electron. There are a couple of arrangements, but it does not require a lot of effort.

## The Electron Platform

By definition, Electron is a platform to build cross platform desktop application. With it, you can build and distribute&nbsp;for Mac, Windows, and Linux. What's nice is you can do all using the web technologies you already know. In the end, you build an application that runs a browser. But, you can still do things with native OS.Download and listen to the entire episode titled _Angular and Electron with Ryan Chenkie_.
