In this episode, the Adventures in Angular panel celebrates creating 200 episodes of Adventures in Angular! They talk about the origin of the show, how each of them came across the show and were asked to join the panel, and if there is a future for [Angular](https://angular.io/). They also touch on where they see Angular going in the future, how difficult it is to predict how things are going to pan out in the next few years, and more!
