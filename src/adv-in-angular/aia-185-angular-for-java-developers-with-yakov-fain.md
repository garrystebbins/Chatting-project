**Special Guests:** Yakov Fain

In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel talks to Yakov Fain about Angular for Java developers. Yakov has worked as a Java developer for about 18 years, and in the last 4 or 5 years, he also started using front-end frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/). They talk about what made him switch over to Angular, how it has improved his programming, and when it is best to utilize this framework. They also discuss how Yakov trains Java developers to start using Angular and the two methods he uses to do so.
