In this episode, the JavaScript Jabber panelists discuss Angular libraries with Juri Strumpflohner. Juri is a software developer that previously has done a lot of full-stack development with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) on the front-end and C# and Java on the back-end. More recently, he has begun to focus more on the front-end with Angular development as a freelance developer and has created [training courses](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner) on [Egghead](https://egghead.io/). They talk about what an Angular library is, how you can create an Angular Package Format, and much more!
