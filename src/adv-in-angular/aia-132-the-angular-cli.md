## **The Angular CLI**
On today’s episode, Charles Max Wood, John Papa, and Ward Bell talk about&nbsp; **The Angular CLI**. Tune it to their interesting talk to understand what CLI&nbsp;does, know where it's at, and consider the issues about it.
## **What is CLI?**
CLI basically stands for Command Line Interface. You can use it to be more efficient with Angular. CLI generates&nbsp;code to help you with the build process, serving, testing—tooling off a command line. Angular, CLI, and the style guide go hand in hand.&nbsp;One doesn't work well without the other. Overall, you still get the same experience of producing quality angular apps.
## **Where is CLI now?**
CLI has been doing well.&nbsp;The team behind it has remarkably come up with a good set of tools that enable you to create a solid start. From there, you can customize it in any way you want. The team is very close to releasing a shippable product. The issues are only&nbsp;typical.
## **Turning Points and Exits**
There&nbsp;has been some turning points in CLI recently. They've conquered major concerns such as the move to webpack 2 and doing AOT and lazy loading together. Performance is another thing to consider.&nbsp;There are some things that aren't available yet. If you need to do certain things that CLI isn't touching, you may have to part with them.To hear about _The Angular CLI_, download and listen to the entire episode.If you’re short on time, here are the highlights of The Angular CLI:What is CLI?
