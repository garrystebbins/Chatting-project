**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Joe Eames

**Special Guests:** Stephen Fluin

In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel discusses [Angular](https://angular.io/) today with Stephen Fluin. He leads developer relations on the Angular team, and he has two missions when it comes to the Angular team: to help developers and organizations be successful with Angular and to understand what it’s like to be an Angular developer in the real world, so they can make the right platform decisions as they evolve things from their side. They talk about the new things that are happening with Angular and discuss where the framework is headed in the future.
