In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel discusses doing more with less and router-first architecture with Doguhan Uluca. Doguhan works for a consulting company in Washington D.C. called [Excella](https://www.excella.com/), where he is on the JavaScipt Special fleet and is a software development expert. He is also the founder of the [Tech Talk DC](https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/) meetup and organized the [DC Full Stack Dev Summit](http://www.dcfullstack.com/) last year. They talk about doing more with less with code and the importance of deleting code that is unnecessary. Also, they discuss router-first architecture and how it can be used to your advantage in your coding.
