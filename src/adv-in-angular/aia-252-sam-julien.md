## Episode Summary

Sam Julien, Technical Community Manager at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) joins the panel to talk about upgrading AngularJS to Angular. Sam has a video [course](https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/) on transitioning from AngularJS to Angular and consults with companies that are in the process of upgrading. Sam and the panel share their upgrading experiences and tips on what they have learned. They also discuss how to convince companies that do not want to upgrade to Angular and agree that sometimes it's in the best interest of the company to present the financial benefits of the upgrade rather than the discuss technical aspects. 

The panel also talk about other reasons to upgrade from AngularJS, the most important of which is the announcement of AngularJS end of life on June 30, 2021. Tune in to learn about the biggest "got you" Sam had on an upgrade project.
