**Panel:**

**Special Guests:** Shai Reznik

In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel talks to Shai Reznik about TDD. [TDD](https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/) is a technique used to write unit tests. They discuss what exactly unit testing is, the benefits of it, and why you would want to use it to test your code. Shai then discusses what TDD is, why you would use it, the benefits of it, and how you can get started using TDD in your own code. He loves that he can use TDD as a design tool for code and that it forces you to write cleaner, more modular code.

**In particular, we dive pretty deep on:**
