 **Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- John Papa
- Alyssa Nicholl
- Joe Eames
- Shai Reznik
- Ward Bell

In this episode, the Adventures in Angular panel talks about what Ward is doing currently, which is working on a large, complex, and involved application that they are using [Angular](https://angular.io/) for. They are using this episode to discuss a real world Angular project, or real “Ward” Angular project. They talk a little but about what the project is, challenges he has had to overcome, and the differences that come with writing apps in reactivity. They also touch on the idea that “the mystery is part of the pattern,” reactive forms, and more!
