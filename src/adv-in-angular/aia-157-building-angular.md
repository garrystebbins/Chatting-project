**Panel:&nbsp;** Ward Alyssa Joe Charles In this episode of Adventures in Angular the panel tackles the topic of build systems for Angular. Since the building process is subjective to experience and options. The panel talks about different ways to build based on their own qualification and prior knowledge of things like web pack, system JS, and much more. Joe, Ward, Alyssa, and Charles discuss how Web Pack is used, and individual problems they encounter in areas of the CLI and other areas. Ward and the team discuss guides to the CLI and deployments. Also, some talks about working backward to figure issues out. Also the key four lines of code. In particular, we dive pretty deep on:

- Issues with Web pack
- Using Node Server
- Encounter problems with the CLI
- Manually making sure production line of code does not change
- and much more
