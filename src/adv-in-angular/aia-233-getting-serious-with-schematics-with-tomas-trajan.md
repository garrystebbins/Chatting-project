### **Episode Summary**
In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel speaks with Tomas Trajan, software developer and Google Developer Expert for Angular from Zurich, Switzerland. Tomas explains what Angular Schematics is and how it simplifies a developer’s life. He goes through cases where Angular Schematics would be great to use. He explains some of the Schematics terminology such as rules and trees. He also explains that Angular CLI uses Schematics as well and that the panel is already using it when they are using Angular CLI. The panel then talks about the setup time and effort &nbsp;it takes to start a project before they can actually code especially when there are other teams involved. Tomas explains that part of this setup effort could be avoided if companies with multiple developer teams used Schematics. Tomas then describes his own experiences using Schematics. As a final note, Tomas talks about some of the areas where Schematics could be improved.
