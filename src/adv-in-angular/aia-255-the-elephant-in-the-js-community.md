**Summary**

Addressing the recent twitter fire surrounding the JavaScript community, the panel shares their opinions on social awareness. They begin by discussing a time they inadvertently offended others and what they learned. They consider the best way to respond if you do offend someone; the correct way to apologize and learn from your mistake. The importance of taking responsibility and sharing a desire to learn is discussed.

The panel considers how the community can be proactive in creating a safe space while being inclusive of everyone. They discuss resources for learning about sexism, racism and not feeling guilty as a victim.
