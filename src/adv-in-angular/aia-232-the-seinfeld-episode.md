### **Summary**
Joe Eames introduces a fun panel only show, “The Show about Nothing”. The panel starts by sharing podcast behaviors that bother the members of the panel. Between anecdotes and humor, the panel shares what they are looking for in a guest to their podcasts. The panel engages in a playful debate about the pronunciation of “angular”. Shai Reznik introduces the more serious topic of state management. The jokes continue as the panel discusses the best way to handle state management and change detection.
