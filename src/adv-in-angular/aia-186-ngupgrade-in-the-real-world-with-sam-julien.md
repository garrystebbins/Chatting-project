**Special Guests:** Sam Julien

In this episode of Adventures in Angular, the panel talks to Sam Julien about ngUpgrade in the real world. Sam is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) teacher and developer in Portland, Oregon and has spent a lot of time working through the issues with [ngUpgrade](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade). He has also launched a course called [Upgrading Angular JS](https://www.upgradingangularjs.com/). He talks about the process behind upgrading and the two phases and four building blocks that are present in this process. They also touch on the fact that Angular JS is very different in the real world versus in theory.
