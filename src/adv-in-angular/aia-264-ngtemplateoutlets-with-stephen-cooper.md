question1: What is the difference between component outlets and template outlets?
answer1: >-
  They are basically the same thing only with component outlets you pass
  components through and with template outlets you pass templates through.
question2: What is the point of a ngTemplate?
answer2: >-
  It is a nice way to define a set of templates and save time by reusing it in a
  component template throughout your application and pass in context objects.
question3: When should you use a ngIf instead of a ngTemplateOutlet?
answer3: >-
  When customization and other features are small ngIfs work great, but if you
  have more than a few options ngTemplateOutlets would be the better choice. 
question4: What is the tricky part of ngComponentOutlets?
answer4: 'The input and output bindings. '
