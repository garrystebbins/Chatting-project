CoffeeScript is now going to be a default installation with Ruby on Rails. So, I installed CoffeeScript and NodeJS and have been playing with it for the last hour or so.

Here are the basics you need to know to use CoffeeScript including functions, arrays, hashes (objects), control functions (if, else, unless) and loops.

In my opinion it is friendlier than JavaScript and more terse, but I don't feel like it's a huge win over JavaScript. That being said, it is something I'm likely to use in the future.
