<h2>Graphcool with Johannes Schickling</h2>
On today's JavaScript Jabber Show, Charles, Aimee, and AJ discuss <strong>Graphcool with Johannes Schickling</strong>. Johannes is based in Berlin, Germany and is the founder of Graphcool, Inc. He also founded Optonaut, an Instagram for VR, which he sold about a year ago. Tune in to learn more about GraphQL and see what's in store for you!
<h2>GraphQL Overview</h2>
GraphQL can be considered a successor to REST APIs. It solves most of its problems such as determining the structure of APIs. You can simply select what kind of data you want by making a request to your REST API. If you do so, you can get JSON back.

With GraphQL API, you simply send the JSON structure to the server. The GRaphQL then fills it out for you. It sends you back the data on the shape of the structure just exactly what you requested. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for REST APIs, introducing to different kinds of applications.
<h2>GraphQL as a Backend Service</h2>
Using GraphQL brings a lot of benefits instead of using proprietary technology. To make it work, you are required by Parse and Firebase to use SC case. GraphQL can be used as a transport layer in Graphcool. You just have to specify what kind of data you want to store.

One way to store data is by visually creating a set of models. Another way is by specifying its GraphQL IDL which stands for Interface Definition Language. You basically write all your type definitions and sync that with Graphcool. This is how you can concisely define your data schema for your back-up.
<h2>Deeper with GraphQL</h2>
GraphQL started and developed in Facebook 5 years ago. Front-end and client developers collaborated and began a unified wrapping existing services. What they did was that they mutated data in a single and unified way.

They put GraphQL proxy in front of them, having one single endpoint you talk to. This proxy translates to the old way which might be a REST API, XML API, or RPC style API. This is a really feasible approach for people to introduce GraphQL to the current projects.

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">JSJ 257 Graphcool with Johannes Schickling</span></h1>
<b>Transcript</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:00] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:05] Everybody and welcomed episode 257 of the JavaScript jabber show this week on our panel we have any night.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ O'Neal I'm Charles Max Wood from Devchat. TV.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I may want to go check out reactor will confer any of the remote coming up you can submit talks we have a special guest this week and that's Johannes Schickling did I say that right.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:35] That correct everybody do you want to give us a brief introduction who you are what you do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:41] So yes I'm currently living in Bellaire and I'm the founder of school before that I found a different company which was called and was like,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram for br but we result of company you roughly a year ago and since then we are we working on Crackle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:02] Very nice note this was a referral that we got from Ari Goldstein who we had on a while back and talk to him about grass to well now craft cool is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">back into the service for graphic um if I could.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to just give us a brief recap of what graft you all is well we won't spend too much time people can go listen to the episode you did with her.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think it'll help kind of set the stage for what we're talking about today so I think was most of it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This episode is sponsored in Masters 2 million hours of front of Masters videos to upgrade their skills in the latest best practices in front end development in nodejs popular video courses of their horses,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced JavaScript API design with note and social and asynchronous JavaScript divas.com,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but I think it'll help kind of set the stage for what we're talking about today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:10] So I think was most of El Paso familiar with rest API.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Raquel you can think about graphical in many ways as a successor to the rest API.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So it's also one of the most of the problems of rest API server example how do you structure a pin in a way to,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">do have structure and pulling some like a deeply deeply message or a completely flat,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">are you can selectively say what kind of day that you want so imagine that if you do a request to rest API you get Jason back.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you do with a kind of send just the structure of the Jays and suggest the keys to the server and just the cheesy ones,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and the Broncos are kind of shows that it also said I'll try and send you back data off,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the shape of the structure you except that you specify on based on the request.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So you can kind of use it as a drop-in replacement for Shi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And it opens up a whole new world for four different kind of applications and in general just a better replacement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And as many many benefits for example it's in general more performances you just.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lose weight weigh less on the date of Anguish you just carry the day that you need.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:41] And you can also stay below the strong trips,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you can get data you wouldn't be able to get it for so the really best way to Japan I understand well all dead of try try and kill innocent.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah really like it is kind of a.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminds me a bit of wear it well it is too well since recording which reminds me a little bit of SQL except it's it's Jason structures,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you you get back to really clean representation of your data which was really nicely and you don't have to set up an,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is this is the thing that we drove me nuts about,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">rest was that you had to set up an endpoint for each set a date I wanted to get back in so even if I was requesting the same data if I wanted a structured a little bit differently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Either had to send back more information than I needed so I could if there in .4 multiple.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Uses or I had to create and points for each different representation of the day that I wanted.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:44] Exactly and then you just have to mess in the back end where you can really maintain it anymore since you have a lot of stuff then pulling or just a few said I'm going to give you way more than you actually need in most cases which makes it slow,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Arbor for mobile devices right so how do you go from graph to well to having a back at as a service because it seems like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I still have to go through the trouble of like specifying what my data is and telling you how to store it right.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:14] I know so you can kind of like if you're already familiar with what's a mental model around Powers though maybe you've used 5 days,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you're already familiar with these concerts,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'll just make it so much easier so they're there a lot of some nice benefits of using growth kill instead of proprietary technology so far,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">cars and 5 days they require you to use as a case to make it really work,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what was up with you can you can really just use crock lso transport layer the end,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">then basically the way you specify what kind of day do you want to contest or you can do that in a couple of ways,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">one way might be to just visually on Craig settles way basically just say I have a model called,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet tweet has a text has been created that which is a time zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The other way would be to specified in What's called the bracha Lidl sofa The Sounds phone interface definition language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And staring and basically just ride out all the air type definitions and then assume that it was our product.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does like the most concise way how you can actually Define your date of schema for backups.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:50] To ask a question I don't recall us talking about this in too much debt before but I was watching something you did this morning to prep for today and I'm your kind of talking about,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike rewriting,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">versus a Greenfield app and implementing graphic you also I'm kind of curious your thoughts on,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but if you wanted to start using this but you don't have the luxury of working on a brand new project,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what your recommended approach should be there in like what success stories you've seen I know it sounds like you get home.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually rewrote I don't think they started from scratch I could be wrong but if you can go into that I'd be really curious.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely do you mean about the graphical in general,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I just grab you on General because I think what I was watching this morning they recommended starting on the front end first and just going,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">bike component by component so if you could please talk about that a little bit I think I'll be really interesting for a lot of people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right so basically started all this way so,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what's the weather at Facebook,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so I think it's now 5 years old and the way it started out was really but repping existing services in a unifying way that from the developers developers like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:24] Does the single unified wave off accessing data and mutating data to what they infected,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is the dad likes their tissues Universe off different services and just put basically a crocodile,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">proxy in front of them,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">today you have one single and when you talk to and this proxy kind of translates it to the old way and so maybe there might be a rest API maybe that's an XML API maybe some kind of RPC style a tie,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">access as a as a proxy layer,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and this is a really feasible approach people to interviews Raquel and the current rotates so is infect,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and made for migrating your existing system to use from jail,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">okay and then one other thing that would I was watching this morning that they mentioned,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">was that it would definitely easier I guess to you like to go with the problems and you can for my understanding you're not just tied to react but are there other reasons why you would want to go with that purse is real.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:36] Okay so you all can ride relay versus Apollo it in specifically cuz I know we've talked about this before but specifically if you wanted to like rewrite some,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">right soda and in general if you say rewriting to me in the back and although the front of the friend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:59] Right right so basically it depends on what their scenario looks like um I don't think that there is a good answer to where the Egyptians Apollo a relay.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It really depends on on your situation I use case,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so if you're used case it's really and that unfortunately not really really easy way to say where that fits on I just need a bit of experience with other then relay makes incredibly,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">fast and give you a lot of nice guarantees around using the system so I'm the way I always try to explain to people as,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what's Rex Canada's for rendering today you that you just declare,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">does Almay component look like and you don't have to worry about that the Dome is manipulated in a circle a relay is it the same kind of guarantees,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">fart for your data on the side,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the cases for this works pretty so you might,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">find yourself pretty pretty limited and Cindy scenarios Apollo is a better fit,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">things give you a lot of flexibility and just the freedom to do things in a certain way how you wanted to be so it's really just like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:34] Spectrum of flexibility in Magic I would say.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:39] So talking about grass ql in general what's it like building a back in for it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked a little bit about you know some of your approaches to creating your data models and things like that but you know I'm assuming you this built-in JavaScript,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">looks like it backs up on AWS Lambda so I had it all together so that actually will work for me if I want to store data in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The crabgrass ql compatible back end.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:10] Right so it's a good to refer to a person in general building Orosco beckoned are some a person wants to use a service when we start with your service and then we can get into what's it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what it takes to build a back in for graph too well if you did turn right back into the service isn't what you want to go.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:31] Ruff Ryders so in general the way you sort out is really just by specifying your data structure so you could date eskina,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">just specifying that we generate a whole set of a guy's for you so what you all,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tropical operations you get out of the box still Maybe,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">go back to the Twitter example and you have to like a tweet tweet of texts and so long and then there's also user tweets has them also and so are we generate,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ideas for you that you can carry,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tweets are a specific tweet and you can just adjust entry points into your garage.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From there you can Traverse the garage you defined relations,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">they're all these mutations the example that you can automatically gets potations to create it reads to update Suites Austin,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so either just your building blocks how you can store and manipulate data,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">everything you need from a from a perspective.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2223 Oran you take data does it say?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah it does so where where are the examples where I may not want to use a back into service.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:03] Cuz it seems like you cover the basics so I'm kind of trying to feel out where the edges of this particular use case.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:11] Right right then that was kind of also,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the start was from Kool and the first place since I use services like cars or five days before and I got off and I got pretty flexible and all some of the expendable,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so that you can just really gets to these,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">basic crocodile operations but you cannot really go go beyond you can and don't have an expressive way to define your data structure,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">to implement something,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and this is where we are taking a different approach than we do from we can buy in Rock Hill,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">with similar functions and provide us like a double islamda that you have two sets of eyes,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you can extend it in any other way you might want to with some of the function so if you need a special mutation can just Implement self,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">headed to the schema and this is basically how we are,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">pushing the limits were somewhere you might want to come and get on back end,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but you don't need it anymore since the things we we don't provide for you out of the box you can just talk into that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:38] Thinking about and about rest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the best you can.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a clear face,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and it does a really good job.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">also as the day comes for guys,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what is the advantage of in the UCLA esposos.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:45] Right so that's also kind of relates to a question we also getting quite often when people off those are all still.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we Implement cashing are amazing in general with this girl scout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I definitely have to think differently all you mothers in the manager's on for 4 numbers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can basically cash Raquel api's in a whole new way and make it really really efficient actually cashing basically ear is about in terms of a data graph.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And you can cash on many different different levels there Megan really efficient to to let people access your data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So we would be free to do as we analyze what are the trees people mostly mostly fire so if we see like these are the top five.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really Advanced queries which takes quite a long time for us to you to execute the crew then over time we're building with that thing all anything around that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maggie's Chris Foster and we also implemented a whole hierarchy of different cashings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To that isn't aware of which kind of data changes so we can store a lot of data and read us which makes three Foster to retrieve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:20] So is there a particular.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:27] Hey Stacy where.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you bility to create a streaming people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you give me an example of a,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the grasshoppers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right on time I think we have to look at this from two different angles so one is how do you implement all that and how do you make it fast I think.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this do something for example give you out of the box and if you're building your own background,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bengals where you have to have to get to pull up some some start tricks from,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">flying perspective I knew where when your payments from from from the front end developer perspective then you have to think about what kind of radar.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:05] Miami expecting and you ride to the Caribbean 2,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">specify exactly what kind of structure you want and if you don't want to send that all the time over the wire that you can also use like a take me to Facebook.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Internally uses what I called and assisted careers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are you basing you do if you don't send the entire tree but you just basically send a half.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">are some kind of some kind of pointer to the Caribbean the crew is stored internally on the server.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I'm kind of gives you the same characteristics as a guy,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of one.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So you basically have one kind of and planned would you would you where you send I want these two SATA.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You get that back without needing to specified on every request but the development I'm still have the same night as guarantees around Rock Hill,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the world is more less.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You're sending the soup of the day you want your sub.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:36] Puppetry of the steam of Santa's, yes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[21:44] Yeah but you said that you can create a half of that and then it until after I get back on to really do it so I want to,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'll let the client tell me what Santa Cruz should give back,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I need basic just started chemo used or off cheese and The Crazies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:11] Gotcha wondering about the security.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know we talked a bit about graphic you out with her but I don't know if we dug into the security of the query so how do you make sure that you know.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know maybe there's this hacker out there named Amy night then you know she's trying to get it some of my data you know and I only wanted to access some of my data but not all of the data right I don't I don't want to getting Social Security numbers or something.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">RideNow social security number check,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm done that's a really good question also one of the things was,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we wanted to do two different they compare to existing services so with existing Services you can usually use fairly simple and basic a cell rules,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what are we basically we never extend tired at across just let you specify,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">gym membership rules so you can really easily especially for something like that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what's a way to link Twitter and for Twitter on one user,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is trying to follow the other one but the other one has first to accept the follow request and just win this,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">has been accepted the musée can reuse a beast with something like this or like a really complex rules which go over manually so you can do that by just specifying basic Ronco trees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:54] Rescue Mission logic and your relational rules you can specify if these kind of conditions,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">allow or deny the servants or somebody be able to read something or update something else on and if that isn't enough,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you can also for every kind of duration specify a set of lungs function which of elevate,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and based on the results but it's true or false are the emission rule against allowed to the night,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">how do you authenticate somebody against graft you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first place right you just send it so we just talked about the authorization authentication as a child,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">step up so far for graphical we basically a lot of really flexible set of Oracle authentication providers,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so you can use services like all Sero Twitter login Facebook login,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you could use digits are amusing simple email password based building authentication provider or you could also simply,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement yellow one,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">if you heard some bull if you if you don't drink but you have an existing customer base that you want to mate that you want to enable,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">existing users to Arcade without changing the password for example so I'm going back to your question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:30] Monogrammed cow level how that works,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">currently we just expecting a day WTN send as an h-2b header with every request so that works for cruise invitations,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">for subscriptions is basically a property is better try on the connection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:51] That makes sense and then on the back end it has some way of verifying the JWT and finding out who you are and what.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What permissions you should have exactly so if you're flexible,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">realistic a break in a little money for the show by talking about meijer.com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tired is the world's most intelligent Talent matching platform for full-time and contract opportunities and Engineering development design product management data science sales marketing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People fill an application and then top employers apply to hire you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:26] Dedicated Advocate will also have your back riding on by his career coaching help you put your best foot forward with potential employers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And hired offers access to more than 4,000 Innovative employers including big brand names like Facebook and smaller emerging startups the size and type of company you want to connect with his totally up to you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And help people find new opportunities and 17 major cities in North America Europe Asia and Australia so if you're open to relocation you can let him know and they'll work that into.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally if you use Arm link you can earn double the normal hiring books.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The normal hiring bonuses a thousand bucks and they give you 2000 step to go check them out of hired.com / JavaScript Jabber.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:14] Exactly so if you're using all Sero then we are directly reusing your hero token.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Um by setting up your calling you if you just share the author of Secret with us that we can verify,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">your tokens on your other providers,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we basically swap out for example of face a temporary Facebook authentication token was sent over from Alice's some and then we can we can verify when I guess I should spell it on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:54] So one other thing that I've been seeing a lot of and it seems like a lot of these back into the service kind of lend themselves to this and it had conversations with you other people think we're going to have Travis to dwell on from,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so here in a few weeks and we had a month adventures in Engler and anyway one of the things we talked about their worst service apps,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you know that the term kind of to me means I'm not the one managing the server as opposed to there's no back into it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this is this a paradigm that you've been talking to people about or am I misunderstanding the Paradigm some Ryan's Auto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The term centralized means a lot of things and it is kind of misleading in a way that mean so many things but the good thing is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">all service encapsulated all of them,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the way we are using them to to to clean all service so what you just said is the server this kind of describe some level of abstraction,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so if you think about Hardware versus two instances,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">versus you have maybe I managed to read his state of a Sana native this or is this you have something like S3 is a whole different levels off of structure,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so if you have your own your own Hardware server somewhere any basement that's like the lowest level of abstraction.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next one is like a virtual server then the next one might be.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:29] Like what thread is RR yes on all of these services are you still have too many still have to think about,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">someone saw how much performance way one to have on an average cinemaximum and which Service is like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">S3 for example all 8 of US Lumber you don't have to think at all about the capacity anymore,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">because you just pay as you go,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">does this really work with server list mean on that level,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">can I lick back of an actually ask a question because aws-lambda something that I first heard about recently so can we talk about,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">briefly what that is I know you,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">hand and touched on this a little bit in the past couple weeks on other episodes we're talking to the Microsoft people but,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">kind of when you buy your own server for example with her room cause something like this then you rebuild your entire back on application,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">has like a framework,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and you just spit it out and usually has like an HP server running and then you can just serves a lot of requests and one server meant a lot of requests.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is $1 in inches,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement basic function and dysfunction is executed when something happens so when something happens could mean as an HP request comes in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:10] Send a request in to the function the function is executed and can return something so you basically getting the function for so if you think about,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">concept down your function is basic me the information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Events could be if you want to use it for a barbecue than your age of Islam the function could be called for every new,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">driving you vent coming through through your shoe or you can have it around as a chrome job and some amazing,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">break all of your server down into the smallest pieces with the functions and dysfunctions executed for for you on your behalf.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our services like Adams Lumber.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I could really give an example of a specific example exciting by really how people who are not familiar with this of like what you would you stop for like an actual specific example.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:16] Right so I imagine you have AQ into this queue every time a new user signs up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday message put into the SKU.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time a message comes in you execute function and dysfunction for example is just responsible for sending this user a welcome email.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can really break down your business logic into small small chunks of logic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And functions do one particular thing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:50] Right so if you have some job that needs to happen on a regular basis or you need you know one thing that I looked at doing with with something like aws-lambda is I have a snack.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Channel for some of the products that they have up there or some of the conference isn't putting on until when I keep thinking it would be nice to hit a webhook on tap here and then have it hit a Lambda function and all the Lambda function does add somebody to The Black Room.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:18] Fart sound so you think about it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah you make the request and it does the one thing and so that you can be a side effect that can be something else but yeah exactly,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know you're talking about and then we can talk about really functional programming,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">WWE can I let you in for many functions in a few way that they met data which you can also use long before all that they perform side effects like send an email sending some Cana,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">text medication card performing a side effect if you think about it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HP request which is being answered,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">this is also just a function which is involved and atavism the kind of abstract DHCP server away so in your application since you don't have to worry anymore new implementation,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buds and bandages,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">call inbox function when HP request comes in you can just worry about the response you want to send back,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">dysfunctional you don't have to worry about scaling things one of the biggest benefits of several letters,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">that you don't have to worry about scaling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:40] Yeah when we talked about microservices which are usually just very small apps that do a specific thing this is kind of a very.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom end of that where it's one function it doesn't one thing and so you can set up you can set up several functions across land and then you hit the function that represents the thing that you want done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually every long the function is kind of like reservists,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but in the way usually use it while you're Michael Services kind of in a Dock Road Closter are you usually host of yourself and you have to worry about provisioning versus with a serval approach,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">for example if you don't get any loads over a month then you basically nothing and if you get a traffic Spike and you get like millions of Free Press then you don't need to provision servers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's basically. You are on our second base is also just not there you can also use like a function IBM bluemix,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot of different providers for socialism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:55] But going back to the previous question actually so it doesn't say what what service means.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing what service mean is kind of synonymous with,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">are these functions as a service so when we previously talked about S3 is basically service service that you don't need to worry about scale,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but there's also this other company called Services which directly to the sternum and Brenda Sossamon,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and they just make it really really easy for you to specify functions and integrating with sir,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">their infrastructure on with certain people can specify their functions in a way they did light.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment with service and it is directly integrated who it was awesome,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so how does somebody go about testing things with graphical.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:08] Wright's Auto testing do you refer to business logic delivered to,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">integration you say like the system and I want a test like the entire flow of 10 years of signing up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they get emails and songs over what kind of level of tests are you talking about I'm thinking more along the lines of the integration tests,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the most the most unit tests in business logic tests are pretty straightforward I think.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:39] You can use.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numbers to test your functions and have a manicure unit test.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So integration test we're trying to make this really easy so you have maybe your existing project and production or and staging on development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What did you do is just take an existing project was it their entire database and so on and.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Diapers is basically.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Run your tests again so make sure everything happens as it should be and then you think. Don't again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:31] The one of the thing that I want to ask about really quickly is just too and this goes back to our conversation about backend-as-a-service and microservices and things like that but do you see what applications going more and more this way,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">as time goes on or do you think.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using just a certain sum class of web applications are going to adopt things like graph cool or Firebase or whatever and just not build up back in system the customized.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:00] Brighton,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so in general I think it's moving more more towards that direction so you can get all of our level of abstraction so what is steps going forward software is mama built,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">by combining existing services so you might use something would like to give you a false and insert search you might do something like all she wrote,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoe recomposing your application stuck with different services and weary kind of fit into that is basic giving you,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a really nice Ventura Raquel database if you if you want to think about it this way and that works with your existing tools,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it just is a better replacement for phone mongodb office crest.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:00] Really quickly I just have a couple more things that you told us about before the show that I just want to bring up one of them is that you're kind of toward the top of Hacker News.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:11] So I'm curious what do you think that indicates about the way that things are going you know just as we kind of talked about here.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:20] Right so we are on The Hacker News front page with a new to rebuild which is called grow up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So grow up facing Souls one of the biggest problems I personally had was grossed out when I started,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard about rough tell you know it's all of the nice benefits of its but we need to get started first with me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HO2 to reuse it Center to get all of the benefits,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you have some development skills and you build your own back on,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">are you use a crossbow back in the service but maybe you're not really sure whether that's the way you want to go and maybe the pricing doesn't doesn't fit what you want to do but you just want to get this,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">started quickly so,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is it in touch with the simple stuff off the finding of schema and turning it into a girl Kelly Kelly,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so everyone would have told us,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">your ride your email for example for for Twitter are you just right type Twitter a tie between which other text what up string and zombie just ride the Dome Run Health Care law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter Davina and you got a girl and pulling out of the box.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:51] So we just put it on when I can use and.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be everything that you mention to us and I thought this was really interesting is this just to your corporate advisors are one of them we had on the show in the other one I found very interesting you don't talk about that for a minute as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:14] Right said we we started that's basically taking all of those earnings we had,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">from working with five days working with cars facing the analyzing the entire spectrum of back in the service and then we sat down and thought about how has the technology in ecosystem,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and how can we learn from their mistakes all the things I've done turned so,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we went to to have one of the founders of ours as an adviser with which is an incredibly powerful so he has a lot,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">insights into incident Tire business and how to the laws regarding providing the best,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">develop experience so that is incredibly incredibly helpful for us.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And you already had on the show it was me Byron who is actually the inventors of Groucho.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's really helpful bugs Simpsons we're working with a lot of cutting edge features around grub kill which sometimes not even officially in the back yet,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Freedom Parton's how we design our system going forward that it makes sense in the future and this way we can sometimes found some ideas back and forth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:53] To to make sure that it's the people on the other side,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was almost as great insights into how well has worked many years at Facebook scale that also helps us to to the final service,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">nice anything else we should know about graphical or anything that AJ or any you guys want to ask.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:19] I'll I will take silence as let's go to pics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:23] Right actually love to add one thing which is that together with me Byron actually we are organizing rough Kelley Europe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So nice will be done,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the first krumkill conference in Europe we have me as a keynote speaker we have the guys over from Paulo and base we have speakers from all around the world,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and we would put it in terms of timing we just put it behind react Europe,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so that actually people are attending wrecked Europe can also attend crossbow Europe and West versa,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so that's going to be on Sunday on 21st and it's going to be in in Berlin Germany,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">nice I wish I could come.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright well it's going to do pics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What's Paws for a moment to talk about our sponsor Taurus Tauruses a new tool for managing and securing the secret information that allows your app to run.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Passwords API Keys database credentials all the stuff that gives access to the private stuff that you don't want anybody to touch except for your application in specific ways.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:46] Tourist provides a convenient way to store all this information in the cloud and they can't access it because it's encrypted with material dry from your passwords with just never transmitted to their server.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So it's secured from them from everybody else but accessible to you this means only the servers development machines and applications you've allowed can access the information to make Secrets management head,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and check out today you can find it. TV / Torus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:18] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:28] You are a baby do you have some pics worse I did send one first one,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic related is something I saw a hacker news I think last week depository CSI Pro tips and I started thinking through this and is Emmitt who has been doing a lot more front-end work lately and trying to get my CSS chops up in line with my JavaScript ones,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I found like a lot of the stuff helpful and aligns with all the stuff that I've learned in the past couple months so that's my first thing,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">highly recommend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:07] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:13] And then I was also recommended to another one called for women only and so since I probably more guys listening to this there's one her only two so so far it is pretty good,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it might be written by a Christian Author but there's really not like,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">there's really not a lot of well so far there has it really been any mention that Blake Christianity religion or anything like that so it's very yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Facebook if that's not your thing and that's it for me alright BJ you have some pics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:53] I'm sorry okay I'll go ahead and throw some pics out,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">first of all I just want to shout out that the GS remote by the time this comes out will be over however you can still get the video,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it'll put you in the right place to get those I'm also putting on englar road, and react remote come so if you do either those feel free to submit a talk,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and then finally.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last one of them in a picky is this audiobook that I've been listening to for a while and I really like it was recommended to me by my brother who is also into,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">fantasies stuff and it is called the emperor's Blades by Brian staveley now if.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Four letter words bother you it has the f word in the s word in in a few times,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so that but you then you know maybe you don't listen it's not.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Super pervasive when it is I can't listen to the book and this one you know it pops up every once awhile so it's not it's not terrible that way but I do want to put a warning out there if that bothers you,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you probably don't know this but I'm loving it on Audible and it's really great and then I'm going to pick another book and I may have picked this on the show before but when pick it again it's called Deep work Cal Newport and it is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">awesome and I think it's a book that every programmer should read so yeah I'll put links to those in the show notes as well that you said you have a pic now.</span>
