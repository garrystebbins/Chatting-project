<h3>My Ruby Story 315 Jordan Hudgens</h3>
In this episode it’s another My Ruby Story and this week’s story is Jordan Hudgens’. Jordan is lead instructor of Bottega, a code school based in Lehi, Utah but also located in Phoenix and Salt Lake City. You’ll hear a bit about how Decamp.com came to be as well as what makes it stand out from the rest. You’ll also catch a couple tangents including one on artificial intelligence, augmented reality, an IoT. Don’t miss this one!

<hr />

<h4>How did you get intro programming?</h4>
Jordan talks about how at the age of 12 his father had a business and with their budget couldn’t afford a web designer. His father offers Jordan to buy him a computer if he can build the website. He muddles his way through HTML documentation to create his first, and particularly ugly website 20 years ago. When he turned 16, he started working on better applications as well as learned PHP.
<h4>How did you go from PHP to Ruby?</h4>
As Jordan got further and further, he worked a lot in the energy sector, including Chevron and Oxy. This sort of work became dull and boring for him. He knew that there were other things out there that would be better. He started learning Ruby and fell in love with it. He mentions that working with Ruby helped him to love coming into work. Jordan now works almost exclusively in Ruby on Rails now.
<h4>What have you done in Ruby?</h4>
Jordan talks about switching all of his work over to Ruby, including doing work for <a href="https://getquip.com/">Quip</a>, the toothbrush service. He has also done work for EventBrite on one of their Micro Services. He soon after quit his work to start <a href="http://devcamp.com">devcamp.com</a> and launch his own learning platform. He says that he learns best by teaching so he started to create courses, usually for himself. He self-published on platforms like <a href="https://Udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, but was also hired to create courses for <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">FlatIron</a> School in New York. His time was spent less in development and more in creating courses.
<h4>What makes the DevCamp.com different? What was your inspiration?</h4>
As a developer and having his own consulting shop, he recognized that camps weren’t teaching certain things like algorithms and even soft skills like project management and estimation. He also wanted to include other things like machine learning. Jordan felt strong on what he felt a true job centric curriculum should be focused on. Uniquely, Jordan has created a strong network to hiring partners. Instead of just building a course, they build outlines for a certain topic and then has the hiring partners and network to help create a profile for the best candidate for hire. Then creating the workshop around those requests. A major element that makes Jordan’s Devcamp.com stand out is that they are one of the only accredited bootcamps out there. Devcamp also uniquely has a 2 year pathway mapped out similar to a university computer science curriculum. Universities have partnered with devcamp.com because the curriculum lose a little bit faster than the traditional taught curriculum. Students are getting hired a bit faster because they are learning more relevant information. Jordan states that the student’s success is also Devcamp.com’s success.
<h4>What are the skills people need to actually get a job?</h4>
What makes a great developer is problem solving. Problem solving is the most important. If a person can dissect a challenge and come up with a plan, it’s very valuable. There is a problem solving course that presents a number of challenges where students learn to problem solve, not even using code. Taking a practical approach to give a sense a real world relevance and a mental framework for problem solving.
<h4>Do you feel like your main contribution was teaching?</h4>
Jordan mentions that he tries to contribute to open source and that he has made a few Ruby Gems but his time is limited. He discovered that even when he was making good money developing, he didn’t feel like he was making a huge difference in the world. He talks about watching students who came from working minimum wage jobs leave the camp they started working very hard and making 50 to 60 grand a year. The camp changed their lives. Charles talks about how he relates with the podcast. People have come to him with similar stories of having enough confidence to change their careers after listening to the podcasts.
<h4>What are you working on now? Anything new?</h4>
Jordan talks about how most of his time is developing new ‘Products’ for Devcamp. Each day he tries to add a few new features. One of the big plans is to start including machine learning into the curriculum. He talks about how when he adds features, he tries to use those features to teach and to create a relevant real world example. He finds that most students don’t like abstract thought patterns.
<h4>Are you doing that with Ruby?</h4>
Jordan lets us know that yes some of the machine learning stuff he is working on is with Ruby. Interestingly enough, he spent time at the Rails Conf and went to every machine learning talk there. Every single machine learning talk was on Python. He mentions that “H.H’s” (David Heinemeier Hansson) keynote talk was on using the right tools. It’s hard to compete with the large number of libraries that Python has on machine learning.
<h4>Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Iot</h4>
Charles suggests that artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and Iot are really where technology is heading. Jordan and Charles talk about how they all three interplay together to enhance our lives. adjunctSensors from an Iot device uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to make decisions that then tie into how we experience reality. Charles mentions that he often tries to convince people that their phones are already supplementing our lives in a way that makes it augmented reality. Machine learning seems to be the glue that holds it all together.

<h3>Transcript</h3>

[Have you ever felt like you’re falling behind? Or that the programming world is moving so fast that it’s impossible to keep up? Then there’s the issue of where to go to make sure you’re up to date. The answer is to join a community dedicated to discussing the latest in Ruby. I mean, wouldn’t it be nice if you got Ruby Rogues all day? Well, you can, kind of. We moved our Ruby Rogues Parley form to Slack. That means you can connect with our listeners and guests on a platform you’re most likely already using. Plus have set up a keeping current channel to pull stories from across the web to help you know what people are talking about. And coming soon we’ll be holding monthly webinars and round table video chats to connect with experts in the community and with each other. So come join us at rubyrogues.com/parley, that’s rubyrogues.com/PARLEY.]
CHARLES:
Hey everybody and welcome to a My Ruby Story. This week we’re talking to Jordan Hudgens. Now this is kind of fun because this is the first interview I’ve done where Jordan’s going to come on the show and we’re doing this before he actually comes on the show. So, you’ll get a taste for him and then keep an eye out in probably a few weeks to a month because he’ll be on an episode then; we will be talking about meta programming. Jordan, do you want to give us a brief introduction then?
JORDAN:
Yes, absolutely. And thanks so much for having me on this show and on the future meta programming one. My name’s Jordan as you already mentioned and I’m the lead instructor for Bottega and we’re a code school based in Lehi, Utah. We’re outside of Salt Lake City and also in Phoenix, Arizona.
CHARLES:
Very cool. I know my way around Lehi pretty well so…
Jordan:
Sounds like it
CHARLES:
I live and work in Lehi, considering I work out of my house.
JORDAN:
That’s awesome.
CHARLES:
We thought we’d bring you on and kind of capture your story, get your experience becoming a programmer and then I’d really love to hear a little bit more about being an instructor for a boot camp or education company or however that works, whatever you call yourselves over there.
JORDAN:
Yes, absolutely.
CHARLES:
So, the first question is how did you get into programming?
JORDAN:
Ok so I got into programming kind of in a weird way. It all start back when I was twelve and back then computers were not quite as pervasive as they are now and I wanted a computer more than anything else in the universe. And at the same time my dad was starting a business. He’s a professional baseball coach and he was starting an instructional business on teaching people how to play baseball called hitting.com and they were doing it on a budget and so they didn’t have money, especially back then, to pay a web designer, programmer to build out the website. And so they told me if I did all the work for them they would buy me the computer. And so I essentially just kind of muddled through as much HTML documentation as I could back, this was over 20 years ago, and figured out enough to build the world’s ugliest website and that’s how it started. I did that for a number of years and that kind of evolved to when I started at about 16 I started building slightly better types of applications. I taught myself PHP and started building a little bit more dynamic type of apps and started doing consulting for other companies.
CHARLES:
That’s funny. Folks we’ve finally found a prodigy. He was doing web development at 12.
JORDAN:
If anyone actually saw what I did they would definitely not call me a prodigy.
CHARLES:
Yeah, well, it’s funny because people have this idea that you basically have to come into it the way that you did in order to get there. And I’ve had so many people on these shows that didn’t. And you know I had to call it out. Hey look, you know, there’s somebody who was actually, essentially, professionally writing code at 12.
JORDAN:
And it’s not well but it was a fun way to get into it.
CHARLES:
So you get into that, you get into PHP. What’s your journey into Ruby look like?
JORDAN:
As I got further and further I started building some much more non-trivial kinds of applications. I focused a lot in the energy sector. So, I did work for companies like Chevron and Oxy and these type of guys. And I’m building these apps out and I got into a point where I really wasn’t enjoying what I was doing on a daily basis. I kind of built out my own little PHP framework and it was about as ugly as you can probably imagine from a code organization standpoint and I knew that something wasn’t right with it. I felt like it was a better world out there in the development side. So, I started researching it and tried a number of different options. I tried Java with Spring tried a lot of the things that are out there and as soon as I saw and started building in Ruby, even just some very trivial types of apps, I just fell in love with it. It had such a clean syntax rails development. It really lived up to what its goal was which was to aid in developer happiness and I found myself actually loving life again and loving to build apps and getting to come into work each day. So, I fell in love with that and I want to say about five or six years ago or so, I just haven’t looked back after that. Now pretty much all of the development I do is in Ruby rails and then a few Javascript frameworks as well.
CHARLES:
That’s really interesting. I kind of came in the same way. I had played with PHP and it was ok. You know I kind of get what this is about. I did a little bit of building this and that. Then I got into a position where I had to build something real and I wound up working in Rails and it was like oh wow. Yeah this gets a lot of crap out of my way.
JORDAN:
It was an interesting way of doing it and I speak with a lot of developers that also kind of had a similar way in and there were some benefits to it. There were some things like you never had to build your own SQL queries. You’re coming in and seeing active record looks like magic. Things like that. Being able to have to go through those kind of war stories early on makes you really appreciate how much better life has gotten on the development side.
CHARLES:
What kind of things have you done with Ruby?
JORDAN:
Mainly I focused on web applications so after I switched and really focused all of my work on Ruby development. I have worked as a contractor for Quip which they’re the toothbrush subscription service. They won the 2016 top 25 invention by Time Magazine. So, I built our their e-commerce platform.
CHARLES:
Oh, wow
JORDAN:
I’ve done contract work for Eventbrite for one of their Ruby micro services and then a number of other companies and in the past, about a year and a half ago, I pretty much quit everything in order to launch devcamp.com. So, I bought the domain name devcamp.com and I decided to launch my own learning platform. And so a big thing for me, in learning, is I’ve discovered a very long time ago that the way that I learn best is by teaching. I know I’m not the only one. That’s a very common thing. I’ve really embraced that. About 2013 I started building courses. I built courses for myself. I self-published platforms like Udemy but I also have been hired so I built some rails courses for the flatirons school out in New York and some of those guys and so a lot of my time each day, the time that doesn’t go to development, goes to building out courses for other people.
CHARLES:
So, I’m curious as we get into talking about the boot camp. I can’t believe devcamp.com was available.
JORDAN:
It was so funny. I had been building out courses for years and I was driving down the road one day and I was like you know what? I’m just gonna look up GoDaddy and see if devcamp.com is available because I wanted to launch my own LMS. And I looked and it wasn’t available, available but it was on the market for a price point I could afford. I was very surprised.CHARLES:
That’s funny. It’s interesting, I’ve done a few things where its like oh yeah I’d really like that domain and so I go offer a hundred bucks and they’re like no we want like 15 thousand dollars.
JORDAN:
Yeah, a lot of people have higher expectations on the domain. They think it’s more like real estate.
CHARLES:
The other one that made me laugh was the other day I was grabbing the domain jsdevsummit.com because I’m going to put on conferences and I’m switching over to the summit style where there’re three or four talks during the day and we’ll just do it over a week.

JORDAN:
That’s awesome.
CHARLES:
I also decided to make them free and then people can pay for all access passes or you can pay because you’re grateful that I am putting on a conference or whatever. So, I put in jsdevsummit and I’m like who has this domain? And then I’m sitting there for a minute and I’m like I’m the only person that I can think of that might register this and so I went and looked in Hover and sure enough it was my domain but it had the make offer. So, I could have offered to buy it from myself.
JORDAN:
You could have started a bidding war with yourself. That was awesome.CHARLES:
Yeah. So anyway. Funny stuff. It seems like there are a lot of dev boot camp educational companies out there. What were you hoping to do with this? What makes you different from them?
JORDAN:
Part of where the inspiration was is because I have worked for and written curriculum for some of those boot camps. There were very specific things that I felt were important as a developer. Because I came from the side of being a developer having my own consulting shop where I would hire developers and there were just a lot of skills that I knew were necessary that just were not being taught at many of the camps. Like some things on the computer science side, like algorithms and data structures and having an understanding of those but then also a lot of things on more of the soft skill end like project management, estimation and you’re also going into a few of the other realms like machine learning, or UML. I just did not see those in the curriculum and I understand when you have a boot camp that is only three to four months long you have to make a decision on what you’re going to do. But I had some very strong opinions on what I felt a true job centric kind of curriculum should be focused on. That’s why I wanted to start my own and one thing that we do that I think is relatively unique is we have a pretty large network of hiring partners all across the country and with that network a lot of them are senior developers and instead of us just creating curriculum and saying I think this is my idea of what a student needs to learn. What we do is we build, when we’re planning a new course, we actually will build out our own outline and say these are the things we’re going to teach and then we send it out to that network of hiring partners. And we say for this topic what is an ideal candidate look like to you? What kinds of skills do they learn? And what kind of things do you want to get from them? And then what usually happens is that outline we send out, we just send out a Google doc with it, and it comes back and it’s about twice as long as he one we originally came up with.
CHARLES:
Right.
JORDAN:
Which is awesome. It’s very cool to see. And we have some people, we have some partners who really care about it and that makes sense because the better student and developer that we can give them the happier they’re going to be and the better it’s going to work for them.
CHARLES:
That makes a lot of sense. I have to agree with you on a lot of the things that you’re saying about some of the boot camps and the sense that they kind of go out there and promise people hey look, you’re going to graduate with a job or you’re going to graduate in a job ready and what they’re putting out there doesn’t actually prepare people for a real live job. And, I don’t know, they may have taught them rails or taught them angular, taught them both, but when they get into the job its like they either don’t have the skills they actually need or they either don’t have the skills they actually need or they have all the technical skills but they can’t actually do the job because they can’t communicate, they can’t use get, they can’t, you know, stuff like that.
JORDAN:
Right. Yeah, I know absolutely. And one other thing that we do also notice, and it’s something that we’ve addressed, is we’re one of the only accredited boot camps out there and part of that is we don’t... One issue I saw with a lot of the boot camps is they take a student through the program, they’re done with their 12 weeks and they just kick them out of the door and say good luck with everything. And we actually have a two year computer science path that is mapped to what you do if you went through a computer science curriculum at a university.
CHARLES:
Oh wow!
JORDAN:
So you learn about all of those and we actually partnered... We had several universities come to us and they are taking our curriculum and they’re teaching it in their schools because we can move a little bit faster than the traditional CS kind of path so they are learning Rails 5 instead of Java version seven years ago and that kind of thing. And so they like it because it is a lot more relevant and it’s something that their students will have a much better job coming out of it as compared to something with archaic type of curriculum though we see it as our student success is our success. If our students go out and they show that they are head and shoulders above some of the other boot camp graduates then that’s really good for us. So, we dedicated a very large portion of our time, not just in what we teach them, but also the ongoing training we give them after they leave.
CHARLES:
Gotcha. I guess the other thing that I wonder about sometimes with this, and I have this conversation with people, is what do you feel like the skills are then that people need in order to be able to go out and actually do this job?
JORDAN:
That’s a great question because that is something I’ve struggled with for years, not just as an instructor but also as a developer. And actually, it’s funny. It reminds me of a panel that you had on Ruby Rogues. It was the episode talking about what makes a great developer and that was one of my favorite episodes and I agreed with a lot that was being said and would put what my two cents is on that is problem solving is what I have come to find is one of the biggest things and I know problem solving can sound very vague and say I know obviously being able to figure out how to solve problems is an important thing but if you have the ability to take some type of challenge, as developers we face new challenges every day, and if you have the ability to essentially dissect that challenge and to put a plan in place in that then you’re going to be in a much better position as a developer compared with someone who just kind of stares at their screen having no idea what to do next. What we’ve done practically is we actually have a problem-solving course that that’s all it does. In the course we present a number of challenges and we say how exactly would you build this? And we don’t even go straight into code. That’s where we leverage tools like UML so we can create visual representations. So say that we’re teaching someone who’s never built an approval engine before we say look this is a state machine, and this is a state machine diagram and shows how you can build all of that. You can watch for edge cases and essentially take a very practical approach to solving a problem because that’s one of the biggest issues that pretty much every boot camp student or graduate I have ever met has... they feel like ok, I know how to do the things that you taught at school but as soon as you get out in the real world you’re going to be tasked with things that you had never really heard of and during the coursework. And being able to essentially build a mental framework for problem solving to me is one of the most important things that we can give to students.
CHARLES:
Awesome. You mentioned that you’ve worked on some of these curricula and that you’re doing this kind of work now in the education space. Do you feel like this is kind of your biggest contribution to Ruby? Or do you feel like you can contribute in other ways you want to talk about?
JORDAN:
Yeah I would definitely say that's what my focus has been. I've done a few things on like open source side, I have a few Ruby Gems that were mainly made just for internal projects that we have opened up. I try to do somethings on there and contribute when I can. When it comes to... I only have a certain amount of time everyday available, so teaching is really where I've picked that to be. One of the things that I struggled with for years when I was doing development by itself is, even if I was doing well financially and getting a lot done is that at the end of the day I still kind of had the feeling in the back of my mind like I wasn't really like making a huge difference. I really hadn't found the one thing that made me feel like I was contributing, not only to Ruby but to the universe in general. When I started teaching and especially when I started teaching on the bootcamp side and started seeing students who were bus drives and came in, who had never made over minimum wage and as soon as they graduated they worked their tail off making 50, 60 grand a year. It completely changed their lives. It changed it definitely for the better. I felt like I had finally found a way where I was making my own little dent in the universe as it were. That's the reason why I love coming into work everyday getting to ... the students I get to work with, I've done a little adjunct teaching at some universities, and when I go give a lecture there, compared to when I Get a lecture here at bootcamp, just eh way that the students interact is so much different. When I go and I'll give a lecture at a computer science class, they are like just... half of them dozing off, no one is really paying attention. It's just not that engagement. But when I do it here with the students, they are just hanging on every word. These are students that have given up 3-4 months out of their entire life in order to dive in and to learn a completely new skill and so it's incredibly rewards. That's the reason why, on the contribution side thats pretty much where all my time goes. Pretty much all my plans I have revolve around that.
CHARLES:
It's something that I identify as well, I've had people come to me and basically say hey I've listened to the podcast for years, you know same kind of thing. I felt like I could contribute to code in a particular way. The things you've talked about int he podcast made me confident enough to make a career change. Same kind of thing right? They were working a construction job for ten bucks an hour and now they are writing code for 60 grand a year. I mean that's a 3 x ... you know salary. It's the same thing for me, that is where I'm doubling down is making more content and trying to put stuff out there that people can get excited about. I totally hear what you are saying there. That's the payoff right? It's hey look. I may not change the world, but I change that person's world.
JORDAN:
Exactly. And that's... I mean to me that's a very good reason to get up every morning.
CHARLES:
So what are you working on now? Anything new coming up?
JORDAN:
Mainly working on... I do still spend a decent amount of time developing and right now the majority of that is focused on the LMS so devcamp.com. I'm adding ...each day I'm trying to add a few new features so that we have a lot... we have a few really big things planned for it. Really revolving around implementing machine learning into the educational experience and so thats going to be our biggest thing from a product perspective is what we are working on and I think that could help a lot when it comes to how students learn. That's something I've very passionate about and also we are getting ready to release a number of other tracks. Right now we only have our full stack development track where we teach Ruby, we teach Rails, we teach the other things I talked about like algorithms, computer science, we incorporate angular and some JavaScript into it. Really full stack, we are getting ready to branch out and we are going to have a .Net enterprise track and some other ones that are even more specific to other kinds of markets so that's the other thing I'm working on right now.
CHARLES:
So when you say you're adding machine learning, is that adding machine learning to the LMS or is that adding machine coding to your courses or course offering.
JORDAN:
Totally both. It kind of works hand and hand.
CHARLES:
SCORE!
JORDAN:
Exactly It works out nicely because I'm building out the courses and also implementing it into the system so the things that I'll be teaching will be real world examples. That is one of the thing I love doing whenever I am teaching. I like staying away from abstract thought patterns, I don't thin that students connect with those well. They seem to really like real world examples. Whenever I implement a new feature on Devcamp I go and show them in the code this is how I added the feature and you can see this is how I translated through what you're going through everyday. Same thing with machine learning. That's a big part of our product launch plan. It's related. How we can implement that and how the students learn... but also, we are adding that to the curriculum.
CHARLES:
So I have to ask, are you doing machine learning with Ruby?
JORDAN:
That is always the question. I will give a few answers on it. Yes, there is a part of it that is Ruby related. Ruby is not famous for it's machine learning libraries but it actually...
CHARLES:
I've bought three books and they are all Python.
JORDAN:
It's funny because I went to Rails Conf a few weeks ago, and I went to every machine learning talk that they had and literally every single one was in Python at RailsConf.
CHARLES:
Oh wow.
JORDAN:
Which I thought was really weird. But it also went with the HH's Keynote talking about using the right thing for the job. I understood it to a certain degree. I will say, there are some great machine learning libraries in Ruby. You have a few of them I've actually written about. I've put them into the curriculum like the decision tree library. The decision tree library works just fantastically well. You can train the system and it can go out and give you what the result you need is. The same way you would with one of the Python Libraries. Especially in the newer version of Ruby, with all of the speed improvements. I've seen really good success with that. What I'll do is, I will... and I like the fact that I can just spin up a new micro service that only deals with one type of script and I can just send it, start a background job and it returns a result I'm looking for. I will say that I am using Ruby for a few machine learning things and then... but there will be a bulk of it as well that will be done in Python. Just because it is hard to compete with all of the different libraries that python has available. And also when it comes to the way I built my applications. A lot of them are very service based. It's really not that hard to go and send a request off to a Flask application. I've kind of got the best of both worlds.
CHRALES:
Cool. Lets see how many more tangents we can fit into this show. Its been really fun and really interesting as well so. I'd love to dig into some of the stuff for Rubist in particular. I've done this rant on the JavaScript podcast I product. I honestly think that artificial intelligence in many of its form including machine learning, are a big part of where we are heading with technology.
JORDAN:
I agree 100%.
CHARLES:
In fact I was having this conversation after scouts last night with my other scout leader who is also a programmer. He is a scout leader. He is a swift programmer but anyway. We were just talking about it and I feel like there is kind of a trifecta of things we are heading towards. It's artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and IoT. I honestly feel like it's not just because any one of them is going to take off, but they all interplay with each other in order to enhance our experience in the world. And so Iot with sensors and actuators which are things that effect the world. A lot of those sensors are going to feed back to machine learning systems that will then tell those actuators what they need to and the way we interact with our world in particular is going to be a blend of IoT and augmented reality. Rather we interact with Augmented reality stuff or we simply view the world through different lenses literally with augmented reality. It's all going to tie back together. We get some of that I try to tell people that your phone is an augmented reality device. You just have to pick it up and turn it on in order to get the Augmented reality right? It tells you about all the things around you. As we get more IoT in your home and around your environment and in your body and wherever else we are going to put it. That's going to be so much more important and eventually we are going to reduce to friction of pulling your phone out of your pocket.
JORDAN:
Absolutely. And it's all really coming together, and machine learning is sort of a glue that allows just for the data to really start making the decisions. Great example is I have a wearable that I use for, it helps me for... I compete in triathlons. Before I'd never really know "am I getting enough rest" or "did I work out too hard or not enough". This wearable I have actually picks up all kinds of data sensors about me as I sleep, as I go out, everything. It tells me what type of workout I should be doing that day just based off the biometric data it's picking up on. It's using machine learning algorithms in order to make those decisions. I agree completely and it's very cool to see that kind of connection between humans and technology getting closer and closer and hopefully helping improve life instead of the opposite.
CHARLES:
The way that you described it. It's the glue that kind of downplays the role that the down plays the role that machine learning has, but it's also the kind of super power right? Because there is no way to know the proper things about all that data without something like machine learning.
JORDAN:
Absolutely. None of that would be possible if you to tried hard code all of that into some type of program. You'd have to be able to go on historical data and have a system that can make intelligent decisions about that.
CHARLES:
Right. Anyway. So yeah let's see, the five questions are "How did you get into programming? How did you get into Ruby?" We talked about your contributions to the community. What you're working on now? So the last thing is picks.

[Let's take a break from this episode and really quickly talk about finding a job. You know searching for a job can be really stressful, scary, and time consuming. Pushy recruiters trying to sell you on roles you don't actually want. The job boards make you feel like you're throwing your resumé into a black hole never to be seen again. And sometimes you go all the way through an interview process, just to find out in the very end that the salary offer or company culture doesn't match what you're looking for. Well, there is a solution. Hired.com is the worlds the most intelligent talent matching platform for full time and contract opportunities. They make the job search faster, focused, and stress free. Instead of endlessly applying to endless companies and hoping for the best, Hired puts you in control of how and when you connect compelling opportunities and after completing one simple application, top employers apply to you. And the best part is, is that you get money. That's right. They pay you if you get a job through them. Listeners of this show can earn double their normal hiring bonus by signing up with the shows link. You get 2000 dollars instead of the 1000 dollars. So go sign up at Hired.com/rubyrougespodcast]

CHARLES:
You listen to the show so you know what Picks are right?
JORDAN:
Yeah! I wouldn't say I hate being self promoting or anything like that. At all, but, I mean a big thing is just kind of what we are doing right now on DevCamp and Bottega aside. Anybody interested in that and getting to learn what we are doing and anyone who has an interest in it, that would be one of my main ones. For outside picks one thing is... it's rare that I get an opportunity to get with a larger audience to point people to other different services and people who help me a ton. In addition to listening to shows like Ruby Rogues who I've listened to for a number of years now, I've learned a lot from other developers you've brought on. I always want to give a shout out to Tim and the Ruby Topaz platform. I can't thank him and everything he does enough for the Ruby community. If I were to pick one guy who I've been influenced the most he would be one of them so. That would be mine that I pick out.
CHARLES:
So if people want to check out Bottega or Devcamp.com, is that the best place to do that?
JORDAN:
Yep, devcamp.com is the LMS and Bottega.tech is the website for the actual code school.
CHARLES:
Gotcha. What about you? Do you tweet or post to a blog or GitHub or ?
JORDAN:
Yes, all of the above. I tweet from @jordanhudgens I have a blog at, I have a few blogs but the main one is chrondos.com and then my GitHub, very much all my accounts are jordanhudgens so same thing for GitHub?
CHARLES:
Very good. Well, did I do picks? I'm supposed to do picks too. Well, I'm putting together Ruby Dev Summit. It will be in the summer. Some people were excited about Ruby Remote COnf. The remote conference setup just didn't seem to work very well for me. It was always on the verge and then it just wouldn't. So I've decided to do something a little bit different. This will actually come out the week out Ruby Remote Conf was supposed to come out. Let me explain really quickly because I know some people will be wondering. Essentially, the way that I was doing it was I would reach out to all of our past guests. I would invite them to submit talks. And that worked for the first couple years, but I think they've been getting a lot of invitations to submit talks. And the other thing is that it's online and so some of them are a little bit hesitate about it. The other thing is that, since I could never give numbers as far as how many people were going to show up, it was hard for me to get some of the people I actually wanted to hear. So I decided to switch it up and I'm going to do this summit and it's going to be in October. I've already reached out to a few people. I've got tentative yeses from a few people that you've definitely heard of. But I don't want to announce anything until I have a firm commitment from them. I assume that there are probably going to be hundreds of people coming because it's going to be free. I'm not charing for tickets anymore. If you want the videos after the conference, you have to pay an all access pass to get that. But we are also going to have a Slack room and a few other goodies. Probably going to do a round table chat or two, with people who get the all access pass. Anyway, kind of changing that up and making it something different. The setup that i'm using for that. I'll just pick those things even though they are all PHP and Wordpress. I'm using Wordpress. I found a theme on themeforest.net called Summit so I'm using that. And then I'm using number press to allow people to sign up. YOu'll get all your notification from Drip.co. That's Drip.co. So that is all the tools I'm using there. One other thing, and this is another thing that I've really failed at communicating to other people what I've got. But Ruby Rogues parley is a forum that we had for a really long time. And it kind of turned into a ghost town. There are a few reasons for that. I think mostly circumstances changed and online forums just aren't as hot as they were. I'd get busy and other people get busy and we kind of drive the conversation along. Well, I'm on Slack all the time. So I went ahead and set up a Slack room. I've talked to a bunch of people who aren't near Tech Hubs and they don't feel like thy have good opportunities to connect with people. By the way, if you don't think you're near a tech hub, go to meetup.com and make sure. I've surprised a couple of people by saying there is one right here in this town is that near you? And they are like yeah that is 5 minutes away. So go check that out at meetup.com, That's kind of what I'm setting up here. I'm doing more than t just a slack room. I'm actually going to be using the money that people pay to be a part of the community to invite speakers to come talk to us every month. So I'm hoping to get people like Uncle Bob or Matt or somebody else just to come in and talk. I'll pay them to come talk. Or you'll pay them to come talk. However you want to look at that. The other thing is that I want to do some roundtable chats with some people. We can all hop on and ask each other questions and present issues that we are having on the zoom hangout. Which you can have up to 20 or 30 in. Anyway I really want to create this community. I'm hoping that the people who feel like they are kind of on the outside of the tech community because of where they live, or what's available to them, or the night that their meetup actually met, they come to this because they don't feel like they have to travel or do anything extra to get in other than pay 10 bucks a month to be part of the community.
JORDAN:
Awesome. That sounds like it can be a really good community.
CHARLES:
Yeah I hope so. It's just hard to know what to stay current on and you go to the conference and you hear 10 things you want to try out and by the time you get home you've forgotten half of them. This is kind of a callout every month. Hey look we are talking about this. Hopefully it will help. We will have the conversation in the roundtable chat and it will give me ideas. Oh I should maybe bring in this person who knows a lot about that and so.
JORDAN:
That is so helpful. It was having things like that, not really ... obviously I wasn't one, but just having that kind of tools is so great for the people who are areas where the community isn't huge. When I was living in West Texas, I didn't run into another Ruby Developer the entire time I was out there. Having access to an online community like that is invaluable.
CHARLES:
A lot of people can't make it out to conferences and I'm sure that is where you got some of that. Anyway sorry to plug all my stuff, but that's what I've been working on lately so. The other thing is that I have a couple sponsor spots open so if anyone listening to this knows of a company that uses Ruby or could do us some marketing for Ruby Developers or JavaScript Developers I'd very much so like to talk to them. So if you'd just email me and then either do an introduction or just let me know what the company is and I can look it up on my own that would be great. I guess we will end it there. Go check out Devcamp.com. That is just a great domain dude. We will wrap this up and we will catch you next week.
JORDAN:
Thanks so much!
