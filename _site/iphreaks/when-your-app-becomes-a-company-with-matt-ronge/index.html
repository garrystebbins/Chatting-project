<h2>When Your App Becomes a Company with Matt Ronge</h2>
On today's episode, Jaim and Erika discuss <strong>When Your App Becomes a Company with Matt Ronge</strong>. Matt is the cofounder of Astropad, a drawing app that works well on an iPad. He has appeared as guest in episode 113, where he talked about <a href="https://devchat.tv/iphreaks/113-ips-launching-an-app-in-the-app-store-with-matt-ronge" target="_blank">launching an app</a>. Tune in and learn how they developed Astropad and how it evolved into a company!
<h2>About Astropad</h2>
Astropad runs on iPad with a corresponding Mac app. It mirrors the Mac screen, and enables people to draw graphics with an Apple Pencil. It's great for illustrators, photographers, and others who are into design.
<h2>A Spark of Inspiration</h2>
Matt's cofounder, Giovanni, was the one who started the idea. He kept seeing ads about Microsoft Surface, but didn't want to buy. That's when he thought about having the same thing on an iPad.

He and Matt previously had a frustrating experience with drawing tablets. Matt immediately jumped into the idea. At that time, they didn't know what they were going into.
<h2>Efforts on Latency</h2>
Astropad has a really low latency. They set it as their challenge to keep it that way. Matt and Giovanni built a custom tech to do it.

They ran latency tests via iPhone, and did lots of other tricks. They also had a custom compression stack and network protocol for it. All these they did to make the latency below what most people perceive.

<h2><b>Transcript</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:00] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:06] Hey everybody and welcome to episode 198 show today in our show we have someone you probably recognize if you have a swift evolution.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Feels better I guess the four but she's doing on the panel today please welcome Erica Sadun thank you so much for having me we're glad to have you here and I guess today is Matt Runge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's great to be here excellent I'm Jaim Zuber.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that we had you on the show before it's been a couple years I think.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when you were launching looks almost two years at this point but didn't there at last time you were here you would just launch your product astropad mq tells a little bit about that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:00] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:08] There's also a course I'm a companion app that you want,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna connect your Mac and your iPad together so that it will mirror your Mac screen on your iPad and then you can use apple pencil to dry right on the iPad and use it like a tablet I'm so really you can.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:26] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:36] Why, Gary Spencer and then you had to deal with specialty Hardware okay who would be a typical user like yes we have a lot of it was traitors photographer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:50] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:56] Free popular on the whole day a lot of illustrators a lot of people working in Photoshop doing all kinds of design the concept is so sweet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to expand your skills mobile development have an idea for the next Angry Birds app then you need to check out FiOS remote coffee produced by the same team that brings you your favorite deaf chat. TV podcasts like broke and I freaks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us for two days of jam-packed fun and learning stream2u Live May 17th and 18th go check it out at iOS remote com.com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:34] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:41] All kinds of design the concept is so sweet I mean when I first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Went to your website and looked at it and realized that you could put a Photoshop I will not a player Candace whatever you call it on to your iPad.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then start drawing directly onto it I just found that such an exciting idea where did that come from yes I came from.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:15] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:31] I know why can't I do something like that with the iPad that'd be really cool if I use the iPad to Mac together and I both him and I had had previous experience with like Wacom drawing tablets and we've been really Trey Burton.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so like the next day when you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:47] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:53] Pain in the butt to use this very difficult hand-eye coordination that you got to use,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you got to learn to,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">how to use a runaway was like okay that's this is great idea let's see can we do it and then that was the underdog was was the really hard part we had no idea at the time what we were getting into.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How is the latency latency is really low on Wii.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And it was really the challenge in and building a mother's really there's really two aspects that are really you needs the tech that makes it run RR technique called liquid and that's what I'm on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing atra pads just we spent just about a year-and-a-half developing liquid and then more time with any nail polish it up and turn it over all good.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">App and user experience but um so we had to build custom Tech to keep the latest CD really really low now it's dependent on your Wi-Fi network or if you're using USB.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But you know what even on USB we can do it where I buy vuse like the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The iPhone camera to take pictures right to latency test and I put like a millisecond timer up on one screen and have it and mirror.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To the Y to the same.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:25] When I take a picture it's actually ends up being on the same for him so at that point we know it's less than 16 milliseconds of latency and we'd actually in fact you need a faster refresh screen with a fast refresh rate,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">to even measure and below that is 16.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah that's below the human yeah that's really yeah that's really.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:53] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:59] To pull it off I mean we'd split the system out on my would you like some.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rehabitation on the GPU before it sent over to the CPU for for the compression so we have are a custom compression stack,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and we have a custom Network protocol that specifically tuned for low latency,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and so kind of putting all those pieces together or I were able to pull off that incredibly low latency and get below what most people can easily perceive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:29] Could you have done this before the pencil drawing actually did I'm so that's that's a decision question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to get lunch before the pencil.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:41] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:52] Really interested in the concept but the reality was the style just weren't good enough like we were targeting professional users but the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Big chunky styluses that were available for the iPad there were some Bluetooth ones to not grade they just weren't they just weren't good enough,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">pros of trying to be like you had a lot of potential but it's not just not there yet so really what transformed Azkaban,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and what Transformers are business to was the apple pencil we ended up being really in the perfect spot for one apple pencil law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:30] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:36] 10 months before the pencil came out it was enough time for us to like get it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:43] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:51] The software and improve the user experience improve the core Tech so that when apple pencil came out we were ready,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it wasn't like one at that time like we already had put multiple versions out and we were in the right place at the right time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:07] I never wear your investing like this huge huge amount into your infrastructure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you set up the business knowing there was such a big Tech investment we didn't know it getting into it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and I'm glad we didn't we might have scared away.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I always described it as kind of like it was like hill climbing where we like her like me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We're like we get to the top of one Hill and then we you know and then we can see in front of us and it like while there is there's a hill we got to climb that's even higher and we just kept doing that so from where we started couldn't see how difficult it was.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We just got me on weekend working at it and like a really come this far you know if you're going to the challenge of like how can we make something that's incredibly low latency,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and also really high-quality imagery that's all the thing I didn't mention earlier is that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it has to be really really high quality.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Noah pixelation artifacts or and were color corrected as well you know because if you're doing I mean what you're looking at on your iPad has to look like what's on your computer so that was you don't another chance on top of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to be honest we were it was incredible technical Challenge and we really believe that there was a market there because walking is such a big company.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:50] We thought there had to be a space with us.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:55] That's awesome so let me listen out for a couple years I remember when pencil came out to un just won the Minnesota cup and I'm thinking.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They're going like right from the award ceremony going back to work to make that pencil work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No I'm actually for the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:17] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[10:22] I never said two largest Statewide business competition in the country and so we participate in that was a great experience and learned a lot from that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can enter that I've been really helping us build a business it just so happened that the final judging day for the Minnesota cop was the same day as we know it will announce also is incredible day for us.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You're literally for we were literally editing or slides like minutes before we had to do our presentation for the Minnesota cup do you take a screenshot of the keynote and get picture pencil in there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:02] It's like that screen from Elf for the get done with Christmas and they have to start all over again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:08] Yeah no I was it was I believe the first when we launched it for iPad Pro I believe Giovanni coated it up and we didn't.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We submitted to App Store we didn't.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:22] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:28] Apple Stores trying to get my hands on that apple pencil so I can test it tonight on the day that I came out threats to the Head.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That's awesome so now you lost this thing and I don't like people have launched apps by don't know yet people have lunch at people are downloading like crazy and using what was that process like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes it was.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:55] We were really lucky in the beginning that we got like a ton we gotta just a ton of initial traffic and got it really started grade word of mouth that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures of a lot of people from that it was a lot of people are actually looking for a solution like that they're looking at other Googling on after the Googling stuff like how can I use my iPad as drawing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we're able to get a lot of new customers and that way so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Really tapped into this demand that was there and as a result we haven't followed the typical curve and with other soccer I've released in the past it's always like whoa launched a huge lunch today and then just like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Downhill from there until you do another launched its place and it's really Captain the something here where there's a need where there's been like his assistant traffic and consistent demand for this,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">how many people are in your shop yes we are now five five of us full time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And at any given time as of right now we have for contractors any at any given time I think is for it yet any given time 3-4 contractors on top of the five people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:11] And how do you manage that the scaling that's been involved because it sounds like it was a two-person startup that they grew.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely I mean it's been a learning experience for us for sure we.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What do this wild learn to is that at United We Grew the team I mean it sounds obvious but in practice it was a hard lesson to learn is that that as we grew the team that weed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have to be harder for us to do development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And it being pulled in so many different directions now that you know we had to bring in other people to do a lot of the development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom put it's been in some of it is been like out in the city as well Scanlon team it's like you know we had to bring in,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">customer support person and she's great she's not dumb she's already.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:12] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[14:19] I was spending so much time around launches and figured out how do I get word out and coordinating marketing stuff cuz the market and Noah from the beginning for my lawn has always been something like Focus very heavily on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you and we haven't just like on let's put it out there and let's see if we're getting a user's we've been very conscious about,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing in so he don't wait to bring on somebody to help us up some work and she's been awesome as well I'm going to do an able to do so much more now with that with young with her help and then so that I should point out to write letters that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked last time we talked a lot about your marketing thing and give it called talk at all, which would have been 2015 teleporting remarketing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:04] Like they don't like you're coming so if you want to come over an app that's a great place to start.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:11] Yes next weekend yeah we don't we spend it on time we still do you know we recently launched the holy website and blog and video and you know we're always trying to up our game.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So that's something we spend you know really is much time on that as we do as development do either of you have business background,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you know we've always had the entrepreneurship bug.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So Mike O'connor die imma go funders name as you about it knowing him and I met.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10-11 years ago now as Apple insurance and you know how I remember back then after that we have both devils and doing my share where.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">New years later if you don't then we wouldn't meet up again and end up you and ask your pad but remember even back then we both you know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had shared experience dabbling with you doing doing caps and selling them online so we had had some previous experience one chain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like soccer products but nothing on the scale of Aster pass.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so that it's been incredibly rewarding and challenging challenging process to figure out you know how to scale up after pen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The development process do you realize that you can't do it by yourself how do you make that decision.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:49] Yeah so that was that was shortly after the apple pencil,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">came out,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and we were really realizing real like while I don't know there's three so many things we need to take care of customer support and marketing and the you know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm going running a business like why we cannot put in the dedicated time we did.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">419 Alabaster battery would just be able to put in the significant,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">thunderstorm length of time just hammer away at the core Tech it was like Wow or not you're not making the forward progress we won like I think it's.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[17:33] We're stalling out here we really need more Hall,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was in like we just couldn't we weren't moving as fast as we wanted and we knew that we had to bring somebody else in and so what you don't we've got arrested over with this now he's great he is love you don't,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">our most recent update Astrid Studio are really she released more than update,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is is Ben Charlie is baby he's been able to do like incredible incredible amount,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">by just having a dedicated forget about me time again like we used to have.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You have invested so much in creating this,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">backbone custom tack how did you architect that or is it all just found solutions that you were going yeah so the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The architecture is very modular and that's been a really big key of being able to pull it off so we have these become like labs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Very broken up in a bunch of different Library like we have we have our own networking Library.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which can be run separately I have the video Codec Library which can be run separately so then we have all sorts of,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">past projects with these so most the time you're working on the tech wrecking not working and after 4 years you working in some specialized tool,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">set alarm for to work a lot faster and losses also to really isolate problems and that's really been a key in when being able to pull off building liquid and I think if we done it was one big monolithic piece of code.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:17] I didn't have been incredibly challenging and probably incredibly buggy just just being able to.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide and conquer like that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">your bugs has been really really helpful and then we have let you know sooner or later the ass that app so that you don't intergrades this component in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[19:44] That's kind of the overall architecture that allowed us to get this thing to work within the components of individual components have been,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">each one has been Rewritten many times what happened is it just like to learn a little more on when I go this is going to work,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">lets you know we do it like I can see that you read it are video codec for version 2 after patch you know we learned so much from the one pointing out that it was like hey.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I can go in the video card component I can redo this it was great cuz it didn't disturb anything else cuz it was his modular piece but it's been a lot of trial and error.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:22] Do you touch 3rd party libraries we we don't have a ton of third-party libraries especially for core stuff only really really use third-party libraries is for like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash report in analytics otherwise I would see no spark on the Mac for updates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But if it score to the experience or the S that app generally it's our own it's around stuff.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">See this is an area that has two dates make and I have this prejudiced idea that successful Tech,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tends to be stuff you control from the bottom up have you found that yes I agree 100% with you now I don't think you know that being said there's areas you don't work make sense not to make any sense for us to do our on Crash reporting service but we've chosen,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">one area truly specialize and go deep in that scene or network in her video component video Codec,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and that's allowed us to do,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendous amount of stuff that we otherwise wouldn't have been able to do that we've been using like an off-the-shelf or your component weren't you know using like I'm 80 Foundation or something like that it's really cool too,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">only being able to pull it off as only entire stack there is there's been a lot of the other interesting thing to his label.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:01] Paisley design you know like our Network like a video Codec is designed specifically for wireless so that's something we couldn't necessarily do otherwise like it is Ben.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is been engineered to fit within like a typical Wireless packet size so we've been able to do those kinds of accusations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That had we not on the entire stack I think would be extremely difficult to do if not impossible.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:29] Yeah I tend to call it nose-to-tail stack.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:33] Yeah I know it's it's it's one of our biggest advantages we have for that bad as having the control over that much the Stag and.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything we ever time we're bringing more and more stuff into our own staff that we have full control over it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:51] So it's a go ahead real wide.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray detect you have in your app for controlling all these things and how do you make the decision of what skill sets you need for your first higher or second higher.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing row is looking for which by the way we are looking to hire somebody right now working to bring somebody on to work on our video Codec really bring it to the next level but you know her,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what kind of position were really most of all looking for passion for being really interested and excited by the technical problems,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and I'm also being interested in this basement working in in my pretty creative software and you know anything people do make and draw on piercings,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">people are really into that that's you know that's the first thing we look for people that you like it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely not know it's more you know do you have the drive to have the you know the hunger to want to work on this kind of stuff,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">cuz I really want to do it we believe.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People that really want to do it I forgot how to do it so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your first Tire like he's a great all-around General developer he's doing a lot on in particular on iOS which is great.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:24] But I know that's not necessarily a requirement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:30] So what languages have you chosen so we pretty much.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:36] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:43] Hey there this is Charles Max one I just wanted to talk to you really briefly about freelancer.com,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm putting on a conference for people who want to go freelance or who are freelance and bringing in some of the experts from the freelancer show to talk to you about how to find clients how to collect money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build your business how to specialize and much much more so if you're thinking about going freelance for you're already freelance and want to hear from the experts on how to go,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">become more bro you're freelancing business then by all means come check us out a freelancer moco.com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:19] So we pretty much the entire saying is active C&amp;C we're starting up pull some C++ in there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But I put the most part depending on depending on where it is in the stack by you don't number of lines it's mostly Objective C.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm sorry too sorry didn't meant that we know any Swift Code and there would you be sorry though.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:51] For us there's that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting thing is if I had been working on after that I'd probably be all over Swift,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">because years before after that I was like you know there needs to be a better language going to pick to see this like is nodapl things like my phone and I come back from Jake of CNN you be so frustrated be like what is this,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">after pad we've been so focused on like just getting stuff done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just like okay what do we know okay we know Hector sea org able to do it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so that's really been and then also the Italian aggression with no see just being able to go easily between see an Objective C it is especially things like the,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the video Codec are mostly see most of the end that's generally for performance reasons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:55] Seems to me if you're spending a lot of time in the GPU you just actually going to gravitate there yeah to like see because.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So it right now there's at some later there's some objective c but it's just,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">with these disinter most lives get so I get called so much that it's like all the sudden you don't message saying this is just killing it so we have to go with,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">C function calls and also yeah but you stuff you know we're using things like opengl and opencl years opencl and also also some metal and there too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And I was totally a cabin,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so in it were trying to extract every last ounce of performance we can in fact we have assembly code in there as well,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we're using me a sissy and Mia me injector units,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">on the exit 6 and arm chips and cats,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">this is some of our innermost functions have been optimized out as you know assembly,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">to get the absolute highest performance weekend but I'm fascinated by the fact you felt,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">that you had to apologize for sticking with these tools do you feel pressure from Apple to move to Swift.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:32] Hey I want to say pressure from Apple to move this where it just,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it just seems like the way that the community the industry's going Swift like script is really caught on and start to feel like it's at the Tipping Point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:55] Type of course America so it was Swift if we were to do this type of stuff in Swift realistic language we get a lot of the same type of performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want that you would do with your performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:22] No that's a really hard question.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's the reason that it's so hard is that a lot of times in the discussion of the language people say,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">well we know the compiler is good to be able to optimize this at some point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:44] That's not necessarily the answer that people who have shipping code today want to hear,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah it kind of stuff that it's like okay well let's drive down to see another area is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is in a very precise memory management and also in,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the raw access you have to memory,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and see where like you know when you doing like Graphics kind of stuff like a video Codec does we're going through buffers and,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and also just like putting together a package that was sent across the network and see it's dangerous because you're at that low,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">because your love always,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">search free access to memory but at the same time it's incredibly powerful and really useful for these kinds of situations definitely.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">20 years ago I started programming C++.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually gets run this but someday we'll get there was Swift.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:03] Yeah that would be great other thing for us is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">portability is important and I know we'd love that like to do this trip sounds awesome awesome being able to write,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">system-level stuff in Swift that's high performance and that could be portable across platforms and you have the incredible because no we're not.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using stuff like a C++ penis is really love it it's just as of today you know one of the better better languages for the job of you don't system-level software that needs to be portable.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you're trying to bring people on your team if you're telling them you're think about C++ is that fact.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:50] Desirability of the job.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:54] So far it hasn't cuz you know we're really we want to look to for people that are really excited about the problems faced and that they are.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They want to use the best tool for the job you know they're really interested in the video cookspace they're interested and in all the networking space that's like hey I'm going to use whatever language and Frameworks and tools are really.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I needed to get the job done in the best way I possibly can.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That's really the kind of people were looking for and I'm so far it hasn't been it has been a problem.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:49] Newaygo love your app is to be invisible how do you design invisible app yeah yeah that's been.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:06] That's been a challenge and we had to do some unique UI to come pull it off weed,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">because of our things we done is and we don't really do gestures when I just heard from the side or just your income and gestures that would necessarily interfere with some.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[33:37] What's into the Mac so we can't your free sample like override do we detect pinch to zoom but we have to make sure that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we don't have her on a specific function for that instead we need to be taking that pinch and we need to be sending it to the Mac as if you're preaching on the trackpad,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">pretend all sorts of unique design characteristics prove that you don't want to which is that we have to be very careful with chairs and high and how we build,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">any Jesters into the app retrieve done more with the most recent estimates to do and Magic gestures that mean produced but in the other thing is to is like you know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">show me the whole iPad screen with the display the mac and not trying not to get,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">are you on the way and as you said being invisible so what we had to do is we,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we got the circle button that you can move around and when you talk it brings up a full sidebars we got this Rich sidebar and their butts actually adaptive and changes depending on the app you have,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tramac but you know we've made it really easy to hide that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">used have that Circle button the ring button and hide the sidebar if you don't want to see it and then we've also made that ring but invisible so you can move it all around the screen so if you don't get in your way you can talk it over to the sides we've really worked really hard.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dad if you want just the Mac screen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:10] We really try to give you that and so that you can hide you know you are that you don't need out of the way and stay invisible so it's so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's quite a bit of time throughout the sidebar design where we have the sidebar that hides and shows that we can really build a rich.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Set of features and functionality in there and settings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The service really well for her doing that or we can know I can be invisible or or we can have the side.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Has it been there since your first version or is it something more that involved it's definitely wrong it was theirs is our first version.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What started out as is it started out as.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if we were the traditional Graphics tablet where you're like trying on this black slayed and then on the side there's a bunch of physical buttons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Original sidebar was modeled after that as if the idea of having his physical buttons on the side except you don't set a physical buttons of course it was so that was the original idea.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is of all the lot since then and after that studio is really really wanted to love two.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let now it's it's more like a navigation and troll on the side where we have nested.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit Rich hierarchy of features and functionality there and I know it seems obvious it's like you look at the how it works as it should work that way definitely took us quite a while.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:47] Find that design.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's um it's really serving as well and it's great because it's extensible to and for something like a stretch to do that we're going to be adding.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tons more features to really catering to the high-end pro has red studio so you know we got tons of room to grow now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm fascinated by your pricing structure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And you know when I first saw it I thought to myself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's kind of a hybrid between the traditional iPad you know app pricing and something you would expect a from Adobe with the yearly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No subscription how did you settle on. How did you decide to buy that your market and and come up with this notion.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah yeah so it's definitely definitely is a hybrid and I just said what.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After we launch after pad and really after the apple pencil came out,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">NFL apple pencil came out we had the hardware of the iPad Pro and apple pencil and so we started to get a lot of high-end professionals using after pad.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm clear that there was two who really groups of astropad users.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the people that occasionally used it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:20] Or they were hobbyists and they played around with it on the weekend and I like to draw in Photoshop but you know I'm really wasn't a part of their day today work flower don't make that use it now and then they want to edit some photos and they use that with Photoshop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But they're not using it then with a pencil.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We started to get users that we liked living on it like 5 days a week you can ask your pad replacing their walk on products and using iPad Pro and after that instead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And they were,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">asking all sorts of Futures and it's so it was like okay well you want to keep it simple enough for these folks that are usually only occasionally,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and we want to let you know prices to them cuz they're not going out you know occasional users they're not going to pay a subscription cuz they're just not in or not makes no sense but then on the other,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">we got these users that are demanding all sorts of really sophisticated features and it's like while we can and we can build these teachers are asking for,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">will one time price I could just it's just not going to work because you're too sophisticated is got to go really deep.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And really don't think throughout his features were simple things like you know I like your 10 bit color.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The color samples and great example of things that would take.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of effort to build into extra pad that really only the highest and prose.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:51] It was like okay we need some way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we can split this so that the pros that really need every feature and they need every productivity enhancement they can get they can pay for it but at the same time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the people that only occasionally when I use it in fact you'll see this with some products we're known for a long time that had the bamboo Graphics tablet really for,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">your hobbies and then another and you had the Wacom intuos,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">intros not charge I got to say it until I was that is you know for the crate a professional and so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been done prior as well you know we really need to split.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Square music group in the two so we can care to each very very specifically.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:51] Having separate user groups.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you manage the different levels of customer support that comes with it and is it what you would expect where you would get,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">more sport requests from the lower one than the Higher One,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah that is actually what we do see we do see more support request from the weekends to do an estimated standard to receive more support request from standard and general exam,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Z's can support equestrian scene from specified Studio are more in-depth and more like feature request like a I want to do this and this and this and Maya.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And I'm very very specific versus estimates Tanner questions a lot more like hey I'm having trouble getting this setup doesn't seem to work on my Wi-Fi network.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you do your customer service deal with them because developing good customer service sucks become a really big part.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an independent iOS platform.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah you definitely I mean it helps that our customer support person she's incredibly patient and a sheet you know she also she knows she really knows these tools in an hour.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[42:31] Install for us to it's as part of bringing that into our development process to so that there's some things that we can't.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Necessarily do anything about somebody has an Enterprise Wi-Fi network there's a firewall that's preventing them from connecting well there's not a whole lot we can do about that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in other cases we try to learn from that customer support.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We try to bring it back into the development process so that we can improve the product and some way to hopefully prevent that in the future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce another's questions or or intelligently warn somebody about that you know unusual scenario they got into and how they can correct it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you get multiple types of employees working on your software you got.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People answering the phone people writing a code you got your founders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At your best Minneapolis is the rest of the team are they all working how's that work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes we're a remote team most of them are here in the Minneapolis area but for the most part B work from home,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">will you have a small presence in Northeast Minneapolis a small office there and Corgis best make sure that right now and,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Sander is in San Francisco and so like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know we're hiring right now for something here to work going to be a good I can we're not you don't we're not strictly looking temperature for Minneapolis were you know were opened up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:06] All over the place and we have contractors from Italy Florida Washington State,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">still working as a distributor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[44:22] What I was going to say is because you're so distributed how to set how do you manage.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilities in stock do you primarily sample on dedicated spaces co-working spaces how do you deal with plant issues.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes I feel like for each individual person like how do you know they're drunk on setup is that what you're asking about really depends,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah we have one person as she does she has our marketing and she comes in every day to co-working space,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you know I kind of very I split my time between home and also according to bed and some other people you know they love working from home,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">they just you know it's a huge positive about the job for them working from home so have their own set up their own little.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:25] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:31] You don't make it make it work for them so you don't want to get into it really works surprisingly well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That's awesome I noticed and most of our audience I think we'll have noticed that you were advertising for the the video roll on stack overflow.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">See I did not say must relocate to San Francisco so that's good.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right definitely not know yeah we had you know hey if you're in Minneapolis we've got you know we got some at office space here otherwise you know remote.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:02] Awesome so we're getting little cut down the time of any of their questions or things you want to cover before we get to the pics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:14] Well I do that though just one less thing since you are now hiring boat what do you think about all those hiring test the ones that everybody freaks out about and studies for is that an approaching use when you're trying to get Personnel all you're talking about like the quizzes like hey you don't write me a binary tree that kind of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah whiteboard um yeah we're not fans that really we.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again going back more to like finding some of that really has an interest in the area and then we prefer people to do a little project before we are there my to do if you don't know nothing on Earth that I can a ticket on time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little bit allows you to work like how you know that's going to be relevant to the work you're going to be doing no I was you to write up a project and you know then we can go over it we can review the code talk about you wrote it the way you did.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than say a whiteboard interview which is I mean nobody and nobody doing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Soccer team in his career it doesn't look up stuff all the time so it doesn't seem reasonable subject somebody to that kind of Pop Quiz.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I said it's like,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">will give you interesting problem and you know use the resources you have available and then you know to make sure that actually did it and we'll walk through it and talk about it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:48] I know that you take that approach socially cuz you're not a.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas buy pickles to the right type of company very low-level code yeah probably some heavy hour the work you doing well up there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah and you know we'll just kind of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk back and forth to about like I level concepts related to an email it's a it's like a video card I might talk about the compression and maybe something.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[48:21] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[48:27] Where everybody has their hand in everything.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so I know you're not going to be necessarily strictly one piece of ass you know you're going to be wandering around.</span>
