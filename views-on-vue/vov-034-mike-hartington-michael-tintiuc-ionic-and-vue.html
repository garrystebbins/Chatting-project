<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guest:</b></span><span class="s3"> Mike Hartington and Michael Tintiuc </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/mhartington"><span class="s4">Mike</span></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeltintiuc/"><span class="s4">Michael</span></a> who are developers of Ionic. The panel and the guests talk about the ins-and-outs of the framework and talk about the pros and cons, too. Listen to today’s episode to hear how they discuss how Ionic is compatible with Vue and Angular. Finally, they talk about various topics, such as Cordova and Capacitor. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:19 – Mike H. gives his background. He uses JavaScript every day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:30 – Michael T. gives his background. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:53 – Chuck: Yes, today we are talking about Ionic. Why are we talking about that on a Vue Podcast?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:08 – Let’s talk about what Ionic is first?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:16 – <i>Guest gives us the definition / background of what IONIC is. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:32 – Guest: We have been tied to Angular (back in the day), which were Ember and jQuery bindings. We have come a far way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><i>(He talks about web components.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Guest: We spent a year diving into web components and interweaving that with Angular. Now we are exploring other framework options. Now we are looking at Ionic with Vue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:34 – Chuck: I have played with Ionic, and it’s fairly to use. It’s exciting to see it come this way. I’m curious what does that look like b/c Angular and Vue aren’t the same.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:10 – <i>Guest explains and answers Chuck’s question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:50 – Chuck: Is it like using...under the hood?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:58 – Guest: No.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><i>(He goes into detail.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:08 – I didn’t know that<a href="https://stenciljs.com"><span class="s2"> Stencil</span></a> was built by that team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:19 – Guest: We built a 2</span><span class="s5"><sup>nd</sup></span><span class="s3"> project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:28 – Guest: There are 24 hours in a day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:39 – Panel: How is Ionic different than other options?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:59 – Guest: It’s comparable to Frameworks 7. The components that you generate are all web0based. The component that you put in is the same for the web or Android. You can have 100% code reuse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:35 – Panel: It’s actual CSS?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:41 – Guest: It’s full-blown CSS. If you wanted to do CSS animations then whatever the browser can support.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:56 – Panel: Advantages or disadvantages?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:04 – Guest: It’s easier to maintain. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">If you are making the next Photo Shop...(super heavy graphics) maybe web and web APIs aren’t the right way to go.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:23 – You have access to less intense stuff?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:34 – Guest: Yes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:39 – Question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:46 – Guest: 2 different approaches to this. 1 approach is<a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios"><span class="s2"> CORDOVA</span></a> and the other is <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor"><span class="s2">CAPACITOR.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:42 – Anything that has been built with Ionic? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:47 – Guest: App called Untapped? Or the fitness app, <a href="https://sworkit.com"><span class="s2">SWORKIT!</span></a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marketwatch&amp;hl=en_US"><span class="s2">MarketWatch</span></a> is another one. We have a whole showcase page that you can check out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:57 – Few apps out there that use Ionic for everything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:06 – Panel: I have done work with Ionic in the past. I found a sweet spot for business apps. There are things behind enterprise walls that customers can use but necessarily others. We have decided to go native and found that Ionic wasn’t a good fit. How do you feel?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:51 – Guest: We do hear that a lot. People want to make a quick app and then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:20 – Panel: We chose Ionic in this project b/c we had to get it out in less than 6 weeks and the team knew JavaScript. Nobody knew Ionic besides me. After that, nothing broke and that’s a huge praise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:55 – Guest: I will take that good praise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:01 – Panel: How is it used with Vue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:07 – Guest: The Vue work that we’ve been doing...here are the core components. Recently we have been working with Michael and integration. They have been working on opensource.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:45 – Michael: It was one of the first apps in Beta and Vue. It all started out as a passionate project for the opensource initiative. We wanted to build something new and use the emerging Vue.js. At the time I had no idea. It sounded cool, though, and at the time I wrote a small CUI program. I decided to make an app out of that. I wanted to meet the clients’ needs and the new tech. I went online and I saw some tutorials and I thought they had figured it out. I thought we were screwed but I guess not. Most of the things are out of the box. But the problem is that the routing was sketchy and it wouldn’t update the URL and it had to be delegated to the framework. The app is called BEEP. I cannot disclose what it means. Joking. I added to the state that everything...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I tore through the screen to figure out how it works. Then it clicked. You have to extend the Vue’s official router...and then you’re done. You do a MPM install and then you call a couple of APIs and then you are done. Not even a single line of code. You have Ionic’s out of the box animations, and in our app we have a dancing...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">You spend a week and you’re done so I won’t use anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:35 – Panel: That’s an impressive turnaround! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:42 – Panel: It just goes to show you that the code in Vue is so approachable to anyone. If you know a little bit of JavaScript then you know what is kind of going on. It’s pretty clean. Especially the Vue Router.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:11 – Panel: Vue Core – some parts that can be hairy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:43 – We are component authors. We just need to know here is a component and here are some methods that it needs to know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:04 – Oh yeah, totally – I was talking more about...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:14 – That’s what I thought for those 2 weeks cause I was looking at...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:24 – Chuck: How do you get the Vue stuff in that and not the Angular?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:41 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"> 20:20 – Panel: What was the hardest part to integrate?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:28 – Michael: I wrote my own router. It was too much for me to write. I thought it was going to take me ages. So it took the longest to come to the idea to extending Vue’s router. I thought writing less code is the best. It took me 2 weeks to come to that conclusion. It was related to how...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:21 – Question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:28 – Michael: You can use Vue router like if you used a different package.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:40 – Panel: It is using the other router history or if you are using Hash API; since it’s all web technology?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:03 – Guest: People don’t see the URL.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:10 – We can teach them to pass...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:25 – Panel: I have been interested in Ionic...when you sprinkle in some native stuff. Local databases. Getting that wasn’t too bad to work. The trick was testing that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:04 – Guest: A lot of manual work, unfortunately. It’s a lot of set-up work. You can do test functions but actually have that end-to-end test...can I make sure that is working correctly? A lot of manual testing. There are some cloud base platforms but I haven’t checked them out for an easier way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:06 – It was an Ionic issue it was...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I think some of the Cloud services to better nowadays.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:25 – Guest: It was painful to get it setup. Why do I need Clouds?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:42 – Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:19 – Let’s talk about native features. How does one do that in Vue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:29 – <i>Guest talks about Vue, Capacitor, and Cordova.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:27 – Guest: Let’s talk back to the Beep app. Lots of this stuff is really easy, as Mike was saying. That’s what I like to do – being a both a developer and a library writer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:00 – Panel: Imagine Slash from Guns and Roses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:14 – Chuck: They get this idea that it’s Java so I can share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Chuck asks a question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:30 – Guest: All of it. You might want to change some of the UIs. If it looks good on mobile then you can adapt that as the main app and swap that out for the traditional designs and something else. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:03 – Panel: I can’t just drop in the same dibs for my styles on my desktop and magically look like a mobile app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:23 – Guest: That’s where you are wrong. Ionic does this really well. We have painstakingly made this be a thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><i>The guest talks about screen width, layouts, and other topics.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:10 – Guest: It’s the same code. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:18 – <i>Panelist gives a hypothetical situation for the guests.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:36 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Guest: You will have to refactor from desktop to mobile. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:54 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:10 – Michael: It’s about continuity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:39 – Panel: Building a Vue app we can use the Ionic Vue project to reuse that work that you did to get that back button working. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:59 – Michael: That’s the whole point. So you guys don’t even have to think about it. So you don’t have to fiddle around with bugs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:17 – Panelist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:22 – Michael.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:33 – Mike: Eventually we want to do a full fledge Vue project they just install Ionic Vue and it will integrate the package.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:55 – Michael: You use the UPI and that’s it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:03 – Panel: Beyond the hardcore 3D sky room games are there any other reasons why I wouldn’t want to use Ionic?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:30 – Mike: I can’t think of anything. More important question is what is your team’s experience? I wouldn’t go to a bunch of C+ devs and say: Here ya go! I wouldn’t do that. You have to figure out the team that knows Java and they don’t know native, so they will be able to reuse those skills. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:25 – Panel: I am wondering if there is anything technically impossible because of the way Ionic works? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:00 – Guest: If there are, I haven’t seen it, yet. There are 20,000,000 downloads so far, so I don’t think so. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:28 – Panel: When people report an issue what do they complain about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:39 – Guest: Being a couple pixels off (CSS), API signatures, etc. We are seeing fewer issues on the...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">People are looking at functionality issues. Whenever there are issues we take care of it right away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:26 – <i>Panelist asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:32 – It’s really done well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:46 – Panel: Are people able to drop that into an Ionic app?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:09 – Guest: I haven’t tried that, yet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:20 – Panel: I have another question: How big are Ionic apps compared to other native apps. When you are using C+ or writing in Java or Swift. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:09 – Guest: Twitter native was a couple 100 MB app. But the apps built with Ionic are 50 MB category. They can be small or full native apps with plugins. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:00 – Panel: Does that mean that in some cases users will have to be connected to the Internet to use the app?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:29 – <i>Guest answers.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:02 – Guest: I have some good news for you all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><i>(Guest goes into detail.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:39 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:44 – Guest: Another comparison is my app I use for my Home Goods store is 80 MB and it’s not doing a whole lot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:21 – Chuck: Let’s talk data for a minute. You can get large that way if you are DL files through the app – how do you manage memory? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:42 – Guest: That is run by the browser run-time. Sometimes too good of a job. When you are doing production cases your...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:27 – Panel: Do you have access to Sequel Light or do you have to use in-browser storage?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:27 – Guest: Either one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">44:16 – Sequel Light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">44:20 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">44:24 – Within Ionic you can use Sequel Light there is a plugin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">44:55 – <i>Panelist comments.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:23 – Michael: I want to add some clarification. You can write your own propriety files...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:23 – I like that it sounds like it’s different than other frameworks. Instead of there being a framework way to do it there is a lot of different pieces you can plugin to different parts that is agnostic to Ionic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">46:10 – <i>Guest talks about batteries included.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">46:42 – Panel: I really like that b/c it’s the Vue approach, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">47:21 – <i>The guest talks about transitions.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:07 – Chuck: If I get stuck what is the community around it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:25 – Guest: It’s still early right now. If you went to the code base you wouldn’t see much. We are working on the code getting into the package. The good thing is that the way it’s structure, once their APIs are set then it’s the same through Angular and Vue. Once you have that API set it’s the same thing between those 3 things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">49:13 – Guest: Let me blow your minds guys...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">There are 7 controllers and 99% you would go to the Ionic site. The rest is identical and that’s the cool part. If you are coming from Angular you can reuse a lot of that knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:00 – Panel: If they wanted to build an app right now what would you recommend as their first step?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:16 – Guest: Ionic and Vue – check out the docs and the components overviews to see what the vanilla components are like. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:52 – Panel: Is there an example repo?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:59 – Guest: That would be the BEEP app. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:08 – Panel: Vue specific docs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:18 – Guest: Files that you can drop into your browser.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:27 – Panel: How soon is soon?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:31 – Guest: Most likely within the next few months. Final touches that we want to complete. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">52:11 – Chuck: What about testing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">52:17 – Guest: Same way you would test a Vue app there is nothing specific for Ionic (at least for the unit tests). If you are doing integration tests that would work the same way in typical Vue setup the only quirks are...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">52:56 – Question: Does Ionic offer a collection of mocks for APIs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:11 – Guest: Yes, but just for Angular. It’s the only framework to support. This is a good call for community members to contribute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:35 – Panel: Would that be a new repo for Vue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:44 – Guest: Contribute to the Ionic Teams’ Main Repository and open an issue – and Ping me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:02 – <i>Twitter names are given.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:13 – Panel: How do they reach you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:19 – Michael: My whole name slurred together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:39 – Panel: Anything else they should know?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:46 – Guest: Ping us and we will get you working with Ionic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:54 – Guest: The cookbook examples are a good starting part. We work very hard with Ionic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:01 – Panel: If they have questions where should they post them – chat, or form?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:20 – Guest: Yes, ask away – any questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:41 – Panel: How do you make money?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:00 – Guest: If you want to build the Android portion, but you don’t want to take the time, we have a hosted platform that will handle that for you. Help you create your build so you don’t have to create all of the native stuff.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:29 – <i>Picks! </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:35 – Chuck: I have more stuff to play with – dang it! I am happy to outsource to you, Chris! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:00 – <i>Sarcasm.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:26 – Chuck: Thank you for sharing your stories, Michael and Mike! </span></p>
