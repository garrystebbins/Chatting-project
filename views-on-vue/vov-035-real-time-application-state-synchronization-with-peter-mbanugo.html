<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:12 – Eric: You, Peter, write a really interesting article. How did you come to write that blog? Tell me about yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:29 – (<i>Peter talks about his blog and his current projects.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:18 – Eric: Tell us about the blog!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:25 – Peter: I talk about real-time synchronization and why you need it for data. You can use the websocket API and other applications. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:29 – Panel: Let’s take a step back. It could be helpful to know: what <i>problem</i> were you trying to solve with real-time data?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:14 – Panel: So multiple client browsers? You are editing in one browser and the data is showing up in the other? You mentioned websockets and others – could you talk about WHY you didn’t go with the other ones? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:45 – (<i>Peter answers the question.</i>)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:08 – Panel: So you created Hamoni<b> </b>Sync, and when did you start it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:20 – Peter: Yes, and I wrote it in March. I used real-time systems. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:52 – Panel: What does it mean?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:55 – (<i>Peter answers.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:07 – Panel: Looks like it’s reasonably priced, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:33 – Panel: Let me ask you this. How easy is it to get up and running using this on a Vue project? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:45 – Peter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:34 – Panel: You have to install through your dashboard, then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:46 – Peter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:53 – Panel: You mentioned earlier that you shouldn’t websocket API right now?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:04 – Peter:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all users would have a browser that would support that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:39 – Panel: <a href="https://www.hamoni.tech"><span class="s3">Hamoni</span></a> handles all of that for you, which is nice. So it has a simple API to use. You started in March – is this your fulltime job...or? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:08 – Peter: I started a new job 2 months ago, so now it’s part-time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:20 – Panel: You can use with any JavaScript library?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:24 – Peter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:31 – Panel: Why did you do a tutorial in Vue and not in Angular or React?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:37 – Peter: I do have one in React, and then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:54 – Panel: How do you like Vue so far?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:55 – Peter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:15- Panel: The simplicity of Vue and you can take an older app and you can switch it over and not worry about jQuery and just go from there. Angular one days and instead of Angular 2+ or 6 now – Vue is an easy upgrade transition for sure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:47 – Peter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:51 – Panel: Walk us through how an app would work with this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:09 – Peter: When you connect you...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:40 – Panel: What server is the data going to?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:46 – Peter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:51 – Peter: I have a cloud service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:00 – Panel: How do they still get performance if there are a lot of people on at the same time?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:06 – Peter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:17 – Panel: It handles all of the scaling?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:23 – (<i>Panelist walks through the process.</i>)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:44 – Peter: No scaling issues, yet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:05 – Peter: I haven’t launched, yet, through <a href="https://www.producthunt.com"><span class="s3">Product Hunt. </span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:20 – Peter: The plan is to do that next month or middle of next month?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:33 – Panel: Maybe once this podcast launches – that’s cool. What other apps can use real-time? Like a chat room is obvious when they are learning with socket IO. Is this beyond Vue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:07 – Peter: Yeah, in general it could be used for real-time chat applications and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:21 – Panel: Stock market updates?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:28 – Peter: Yes. No, not animals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe games for multi-player games. For chat room application. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:45 – Panel: <a href="https://demopuppy.com/en/"><span class="s3">Demopuppy.com</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/">19:11 – Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:00 – Peter: Related to the blog we have covered it well. Why you would use real-time and the different ways you can do it with websocket.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:23 – Panel: You are in Nigeria?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:24 – Peter: Yes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:27 – Panel: How is Vue.js in Nigeria – do you have <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetups?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:44 – Peter: I think the tech scene is doing quite well. Mainly Angular and others use other frameworks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:08 – Panel: Conference and asking for people to contribute? (Yes.) That sounds great for an active community. Getting hard jobs in tech is hard but maybe hard in specific places.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:39 – Peter: It is great the great one for React b/c of the popularity in React. React or Angular; one of the two. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:12 – Panel: If you know your stuff you are good to go?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:19 – Peter: Yes. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net"><span class="s3">Microsoft’s .NET</span></a> is quite stable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:37 – Panel: You are starting a startup is that common in Nigeria?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:49 – Peter: The startup is small actually. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:37 – Panel: Are you in the capitol? (Yes.) There is a misconception there that people think you have to be in the California or bay area, and you can see that it’s not true. You can create cool things no matter where you are!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:08 – Peter: It’s great to see the diversity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:14 – Panel: I think it’s cool what you are doing. I am glad you wrote an article. What is <a href="http://hospitalrun.io"><span class="s3">HospitalRun?</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:42 – Peter: It’s a hospital management system to work offline first. To use them in remote areas where there is no connectivity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:08 – Panel: It’s an opensource project – <a href="http://hospitalrun.io"><span class="s3">Hospital.io.</span></a> You are more the maintainer of the frontend right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:05 – Peter: Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:11 – Panel: A lot of hospitals are using this and need contributors and if you want to have a real difference check it out. What do you do as the maintainer are you reviewing code requests?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:40 – Peter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:56 – Panel: Ember.js?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:00 – Peter: No, I am being dumped into Ember into the deep-end. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:20 – Panel: I think we are going to go to our picks now? How can </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:30 – Peter: Twitter and email. Check out the show notes!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:50 – Panel: Picks!</span></p>
