<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this episode, the panel talks about code automation, generators, and other topics. They talk about the pros and cons of what generators can and cannot do. Later they discuss different codes, such as Prettier and Eslint codes, and also talk about their pros and cons. Check-out today’s episode to get the full details on these topics and much more! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:03 – Panel has different views on what code automation is and or is not. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:53 – One of the panelists started his career with <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"><span class="s3">Rails.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:58 – Let’s jump into one thing that I think Rails did really well, and that is generators! Generators aren’t really popular in the <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s3">JavaScript</span></a> community. What are generators?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:43 – Generators is to help build your tooling. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:57 – What is an example of a generator, and how can it resolve the issue-at-hand?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:04 – To generate a component, for example. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:20 – The panel go back and forth and discuss the different definitions of what a generator means to them, and the purpose of a generator. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:29 – For beginners, if you are brand new to <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s3">JavaScript</span></a> then these generators could be confusing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:10 – People at first did not like Java’s generators. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:04 – How much do you guys use generators in your workday? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s4">10:07 – <a href="https://cli.angular.io"><span class="s3">Angular CLI</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:06 – To organize in a consistent way for a larger team, generators can help. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:37 – It also standardizes things, too. If you have something in place, then basically the machine makes the decision for you already, which can save some headaches. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:09 – Tooling to review code. As long as you can agree on a style then these tools can format your code the way you want it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:49 – Let’s talk about <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint"><span class="s3">Prettier and Eslint code</span></a>. Let’s take a poll. The panel goes back-and-forth and discusses the pros and cons of both codes, Prettier and Eslint. Some panelists have very strong views on one or the other, and they’ve had much experience with these codes, which they have given it much thought over the years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:36 – Bottom line: we all figure out things as we go along.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:52 – New topic: Apart of the automated code review is to have Eslint and Prettier and other codes have all of these things run-on a pre-commit hook, only on the files that are staged. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:06 – Who uses pre-commit hooks? A lot of people will run different tools to compress their images, and there is a tool that can help with that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:32 – Smart - anything to save time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:40 – New topic: Continuation integration. After a pre-commit hook in editor, then when you take a poll request then sometimes there are these services, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/continuous-integration-circleci-vs-travis-ci-vs-jenkins-41a1c2bd95f5"><span class="s3">Travis CI or CircleCI</span></a> that will go through and run some tests to make sure that your project builds correctly, and deploy your site. I like to use tools like this. It integrates with others like <a href="https://github.com"><span class="s3">GitHub</span></a> among others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:54 – Digital Ocean’s Advertisement!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:58 – If you want to see an example please got to this timestamp to hear the panelist’s suggestion! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:03 – Once an application has been developed for a while it might take 4-5 minutes for it to finish – if I think it is fine, I don’t want to waste time. It doesn’t seem like a good use of my time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:23 – “Throwing out data is like gardening!” – This is Divya’s motto. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:40 – One panelist likes to use the squash and merging option.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:14 – Divya: “Do you have any control over what gets squashed?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:28 – Everything gets squashed </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:49 – Auto-completion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:27 – The panel talks about plugins and such. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:10 – Back to continuation integration (CI). Biggest concern people have is it builds failing when nothing is wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:00 – “Time Zones” – that’s one scenario for Divya. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:32 – Another panelist voices another concern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">45:31 – Another topic: Running Eslint and Prettier – how do we actually run those things? How do we run tests? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:24 – The panel talks about what was and is popular within this field. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">50:29 – Question asked. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">50:41 – Proxies is very common.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">54:46 – Another common web pack customization is when you have to use environmental variables. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">55:55 – Anyone have anything else to talk about? No, so let’s talk about PICKS!</span></p>
