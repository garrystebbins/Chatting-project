<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks amongst themselves on the topic: how does one contribute to opensource work? They discuss their various ways that they contribute, such as speaking at conferences, recording videos for YouTube, podcasting, among others. Check-out today’s episode to get some insight and inspiration of how YOU can contribute to YOUR community! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:31 – Erik: Contributing to opensource – and being a good resource for the community. Contributing and still making a living. If people want to make this more sustainable and doing work for the community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:26 – Chuck: What do you been by “contributing” – because people could think that “code contributions” would be it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:50 – Erik: Answering people’s questions in a chat, code contributions, or doing a podcast or doing a blog posts. I think there are a lot of ways to contribute. Really anything to make their lives and work easier.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:33 – Panelist: Can we go around and ask the panel individually what THEY do?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It could be as simple as mentoring someone at your work. I’m curious to see what the panelist members have done. Sometimes you can get paid for those contributions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:40 – Panelist: I am super scared to contribute source code. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I really love organizing things: Meetups, conferences, etc. That’s my favorite sort of work. It is also terrifying, though, too. Educational content and organizing conferences are my favorite ways to contribute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:10 – Panelist: Why is that attractive for you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:22 – Panelist: That’s a good question. I’ve already started planning for the 2022 conference. It’s very physical – there are people that are present. Very direct interaction. My second favorite is sometimes I will teach at local boot camp, and the topic is about <i>interviewing</i>. There is interaction there, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:32 – Panelist: Why do you think organizing conferences is useful?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:46 – Panelist: Top way is that I will hear stories after the fact. “Oh I came to the conference, met this person, and now I have a new job that pays 30% more...thank you!” Stories like that are rewarding. It’s a ripple effect. A conference the main thing you are putting out there are videos (main product) going to YouTube. The people that are there, at the conference, are interacting people and they are making friends and making contacts. It inspires them to do better. John Papa just goes out there to talk into the hallway. You can talk to Chris Fritz in the hall. Make yourself available. You are the celebrities and people want to meet you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:20 – Panel talks about how desperate they are to talk to Chris. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:36 – Panelist: Going to conferences and meeting other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:08 – Panelist: Taking part of conferences in other ways. That’s something that you do <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shortdiv"><span class="s4">Divya Sasidharan</span></a></span><span class="s2">?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:33 – Divya: It depends on your personality. You get to speak as a speaker, because you get visibility fast. I don’t think you don’t have to speak if you don’t want to speak. Anything within your community that is beneficial. Or the one-to-one interactions are great. Having a conversation with another person that cannot respond. It’s nice to give a speech because it’s a one-way conversation. I like the preparation part of it. The delivery is the nerves, afterwards is a high because it’s over with. I really like writing demos. For the demos I put in a lot of time into it. It gives me the space and time constraint to work on those demos. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:10 – Do you like the preparation or the delivery?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:20 – Preparation part that I do not like as much because it is nerve-wrecking, and then the anticipation to go up there on stage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:55 – Panelist: I am nervous until when it starts. Once I start talking – well that’s it! Can’t go back now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:26 – John: I have given a few talks at a conference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:39 – Panelist: Doing good and contributing. I knew John Papa when he was in Microsoft in 2000/2001. I read about it. Everyone knew about him. It would be so GREAT to meet John Papa, and now we are friends! We get to talk about personal stuff and I learn from him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:42 – Chris: I have had moments like that, too. Act like they are a normal person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:01 – Chuck: After I walk off the stage people want to talk to me afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:24 – John: For my personal style, I learn about talking at conferences. I spend a lot of times building a demo. I don’t spend a lot of times with decks. I work on the code, the talk separately. I whip that up quickly, so I don’t </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">This is the story I am going to tell – that’s what I tell myself before I do a talk at a conference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Afterwards, people come up to you years later – and they give you these awesome feedback comments. It’s a huge reward and very fulfilling. There was someone in this world you were able to impact. That’s why I like teaching. I watch the sessions on YouTube. I want to have deep conversations with people. You are missing out if you aren’t talking to people at the conference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:26 – Panelist: Yeah, I agree. I do a lot of YouTube videos. I write a blog for a few years on Node and such. Then I got into videos, and helping new developers. Videos on Vue.js. Like you, Joe, I try to combine the two. If I can help myself, and OTHERS, that is great. I promote my own courses, my own affiliate links. It’s really fun talking in front of a video camera. Talking through something complex and making it simple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:52 – Panelist: Creating videos vs. speaking at a conference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:02 – Panelist: My bucket list is to do my conferences. I want to start putting out proposals. Easiest thing for me is to make videos. I used to do 20 takes before I was happy, but now I do one take and that’s it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">256:00 – Sounds like lower effort. You don’t have to ask anyone for permission to do a YouTube video.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:21 – Panelist: Even if you are a beginner, then you can probably help others, too. At first, you feel like you are talking to yourself. If anything else, you are learning and you are getting experience. The <b><i>ruby ducky</i></b> programming. Talking to something that cannot respond to you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:11 – Like when I write a...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:29 – Check out duck punching, and Paul Irish. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">28:00 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s2">Digital Ocean</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:42 – The creativity of doing YouTube videos. Is that rewarding to be creative or the organization? What part do you like in the creation process?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:23 – I think a blog you have text you can be funny you can make the text interesting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">With videos it’s a whole new world of teaching. YouTubers teaching certain concepts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are other people that have awesome animations. If I wanted to talk about a topic and do something simple or talk outside – there are a ton of different ways</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:10 – Panelist: Some times I just want to go off and be creative; hats-off to you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:28 – Panelist: I have tried to do a course with time stamps and certain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:00 – D: Do you have a process of how you want to create your videos – what is your process?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:22 – Panelist: I have a list of topics that I want to talk about. Then when I record it then I have a cheat sheet and I just go. Other people do other things, though. Like sketches and story boarding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:16 – D: Fun, fun, function. He has poster boards that he holds up and stuff. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:36 – Panelist: People who listen to this podcast might be interested in podcasting?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:54 – Panelist: Anyone who runs a podcast, Chuck?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:16 – Chuck: When I started podcasting – I initially had to edit and publish – but now I pay someone to do it. It is a lot more work than it is. All you have to do is record and have a decent microphone, and put it out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:18 – Panelist: It’s a labor of love. You almost lost your house because at first it wasn’t profitable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:45 – Chuck: Yeah for the most part we have it figured it out. Even then, we have 12 shows on the network on DevChat TV. 3 more I want to start and I want to put those on YouTube. Some people want to be on a new show with me. We will see. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">36:37 – Chuck: I have a lot of people who asked about Python. We all come together and talk about what we are doing and seeing. It’s the water cooler discussion that people can hear for themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The conversation that you wish you could have to talk to experts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:03 – Podcasts provide that if you cannot get that at a conference?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:16 – Conference talks are a little bit more prepared. We can go deeper in a podcast interview, because we can bring them back. You can get as involved as you want. It’s also </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:53 – Chuck: Podcasting is good if there is good content and it’s regular. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:09 – Panelist: What is GOOD content?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:20 – Chuck: There are different things people want. Generally they want something like:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Staying Current</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Staying on the Edge</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">When you go into the content it’s the host(s). I identify the way this host says THIS a certain way or that person says something THAT Way. That is all community connection. We do give people an introduction to topics that they might not hear anywhere else.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">With a Podcast if something new comes up we can interview someone THIS week and publish next week. Always staying current.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:36 – Chuck: A lot of things go into it and community connection and staying current.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">41:52 – Panelist: How to get started in EACH of the things we talked about. How do we try to get paid for some of these things? So we can provide value to communities. Talking about money sometimes is taboo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:36 – Panelist: Those are full topics all in by themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:55 – Chuck: Sustainability – let’s talk about that. I think we can enter into that </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">44:15 – Panelist: How do you decide what’s for free and what you are charging? How do you decide?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">44:55 – Joe: I think one thing to start off is the best way to operate – do it because you feel like it needs to be done. The money follows. The minute you start solving people’s problems, money will follow. It’s good to think about the money, but don’t be obsessed. React conference. The react team didn’t want to do the conference, but it’s got to happen. The money happened afterwards. The money follows. Look for opportunities. Think ahead and be the responsible one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">47:28 – Panelist: If you want to setup a Meetup then go to...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">47:45 – Panelist: I bet if you went to a Meet up and said you want to help – they would love that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">47:59 – Panelist: Yes, do something that is valuable. But events you will have a budget. Is it important to have money afterwards or try to break even? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:38 – Joe: I think having money after the conference is just fine. The #1 thing is that if you are passionate about the project then you will make decisions to get that project out there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I can’t spend 500+ hours on something that it won’t help me pay my mortgage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:29 – Panelist: It’s not greedy to want money. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:46 – Panelist: It’s a very thankless job. Many people don’t know how much effort goes into a conference. It’s a pain. People like Joe will put in 90 hours a week to pull off a conference. It’s a very, very difficult job. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:42 – Panelist: Question to Divya. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">54:00 – Divya: I have only been speaking for about a year now. For me, I feel this need to speak at different events to get my name out there. You wan the visibility, access to community and other benefits. These things trump the speaker’s fee. As I get more experience then I will look for a speaker’s fee. This fee is a baseline to make sure that you are given value for your time and effort. Most conferences do pay for your hotel and transportation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:58 – Panelist: How much is worth it to me to go and speak? Even if at the lower level; but someone who is a luminary in the field (John Papa). But for me it’s worth it. I am willing to spend my own dime. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:14 – Panelist: John?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:37 – John: You learn the most when you listen. I am impressed on your perspectives. Yes, early on you’ve got to get your brand out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It’s an honor to speak then I’m honored.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Do I have time?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Will my family be okay if I am gone 3-4 days?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Is this something that will have an impact in some way?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Will I make connections? Will I be able to help the community? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">There is nothing wrong with saying I need to be paid X for that speech. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It’s all of the blood, sweat, and tears that go into it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:30 – Panelist chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I run conferences we cannot even cover their travel costs. Other conferences we can cover their travel costs; and everything in-between. There is nothing wrong with that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:02:11 – You have to be financially sound. Many of us do workshops, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:02:59 – How do you get paid for podcasting? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03:11 – Chuck: I do get crap for having ads in the podcast. Nobody knows how much editing goes into one episode. It takes money for hosting, and finding guests, and it costs through Zoom. The amount of time it takes to produce these 12 shows is time-consuming. If you want to get something sponsored. Go approach companies and see. Once you get larger 5-10,000 listeners then that’s when you can pay your car payment. It’s a labor of love at first.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The moral is that you WANT to do what you are doing. </span></p>
