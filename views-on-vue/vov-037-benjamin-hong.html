<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:32 – Panel: Hi! Welcome – our panel today is live at Park City, UT. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:34 – <i>Benjamin introduces himself.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:41 – Panel: Politico is a well trafficked website and it’s well known. What are your thoughts about working on a well trafficked website?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:22 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:44 – Panel: Why did you settle on Vue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:50 – Guest: ...I came onto the team and was passionate about helping. We built out the component types. I thought Vue was better suited for the team. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:36 – Panel: That’s a large team – that’s a lot of people</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:45 – Guest: Yeah, at one time I was writing everything. A lot of people on the team right now didn’t know a lot of JavaScript – but having Vue helps everyone to move the project forward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:29 – Panel: They can write just HTML, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:38 – Guest: Yep, exactly. It helps with communication.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:55 – <i>Panel asks a question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:00 – Guest: I use an event bust. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:20 – Chuck: Did you have to move from an event bust to <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org"><span class="s5">Vuex</span></a> and what was that like?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:30 – Guest: We had to move into module-esque anyways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:42 – Panel: You probably have <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org"><span class="s5">Vuex</span></a> with modules and...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:54 – Guest: We are using your enterprise broiler plate! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:05 – Panel: Yeah, every team uses their own patterns. What files would I see used within your team? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:16 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:55 – <i>Panel asks a question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:01 – Guest: We can keep with the recommended packages fairly well!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:21 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:26 – Guest: Funny enough at London...we are starting to get a lot with our co-coverage. We have a hard time balancing with unit tests and...eventually we want to look at Cypress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:12 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:15 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:19 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:38 – Panel: I always encourage people to test the unit tests. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:00 – Chuck: As you adopted Vue what was it like to get buy-in from management. Usually they have a strong backend with Rails, and someone comes in and says let’s use X. How do you sell them on: we are going to use this new technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:30 – Guest: We could really use the user-experience better, and also to offload things from the backend developers. Our desire was to control more things like animation and to specialize those things. That was my selling point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:32 – Chuck: I tend to do both on the apps that I’m working on. I told Chris that I was going to switch a lot of things to Vue – some of the things you said I am not interested in the backend b/c it’s too painful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:01 – Panel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:08 – Chuck: There are things that are really, really good on the backend, but...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:18 – Panel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:24 – Panel: You get the benefits of rendering...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:43 – Chuck: What are your challenges into Vue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:50 – Guest: It’s definitely the scale, because we were a team of 5 and now we are a team of 15. Also, the different time changes b/c we have some people who live in India. Getting that workflow and we are looking at STORYBOOK to help with that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:30 – Chuck: Every person you add doubles the complexity of the group.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:40 – Panel: I think that is conservative!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:49 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:56 – Panel: I get to see Chuck in person so this is different!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:09 – Panel: Challenge accepted!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:18 – Panel: This is the roast!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:25 – Panel: Are you working, Benjamin, on a component library? Are you working on that alongside your current project? How do you manage that/</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:38 – Guest: Unfortunately, we have a lot of deadlines and everything is running in parallel! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:00 – Panel: How do you implement expectations throughout your team?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:13 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:16 – Guest: It’s for everyone to understand their own expectations and the team’s expectations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I have to be able to parse it out w/o giving them too much guidance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:20 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:25 – Guest: Yep!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:30 – Panel: ...having to edit the same files and the same lines...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:36 – Guest: We have been able to keep those in their own lanes!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:44 – Panel: Yeah that’s no fun – I’ve been there!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:53 – Chuck: You are working in the development branch – and then their thing breaks my thing, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:08 – Panel: You are doing dimensional travel! It’s almost like reorganizing a complete novel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:30 – Guest: You don’t want your work to drag on too long b/c you don’t want to poorly affect the other team members. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:53 – Panel: Does that mean you use internal docs to help with the workflow?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:03 – Guest: Yes, we use the common team board. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:30 – <i>Panel asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:39 – Guest: Yes, that’s a challenge. I have setup an internal product called Politico Academy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:29 – Chuck: How do you fit into what Politico is doing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:45 – Guest: They are giving out cutting edge information regarding policies and that sort of thing. We have tools like compass to track your notes within the team and also bills. Politico Pro is like for lobbyists and those fees are very expensive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:23 – Panel: Do you have to create graphs and D3 and stuff like that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:35 – Guest: I am itching to do that and we haven’t really done that, yet. I would love to do that, though! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:42 – Panel: Chris will be talking about that which will air on YouTube!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:02 – Panel: Ben, you make decisions based on architecture – do the members of the team get to contribute to that or no?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:27 – Guest: Yeah, I have a democratic approach. I want people to show their opinion, so that way they know that their voice is getting heard. I don’t make all the decisions, but I do give some guidelines. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:11 – Chris: I like to time box it. I do the same thing, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:49 – Chuck: Yeah someone would propose something to a new feature (or whatnot) and we would want to see if we want to explore it now or later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:55 – <i>Panel goes back-and-forth.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:26 – Panel: On that note- you want to make sure that each developer has submitted a pole request per day. What is universal in regards to coding practices, and code comments, and stuff like that and code style?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:55 – Guest: We do PREMIER across the board right now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:55 – Panel asks a question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:08 – Guest: I like having more...if it can show WHY you did it a certain way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:33 – Panel: It’s good not to save the data.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:40 – Chris: Sometimes a SQUASH can be helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:50 – Divya: I try to commit often and my work is a work in-progress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:08 – Chris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:13 – Chuck comments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:24 – <i>Panel goes back-and-forth!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:43 – Guest: They will write their code and then use Prettier and it will look terrifying b/c it’s like what did you just do. I want them to see the 2 lines they changed rather than the whole file. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:13 – <i>Panelist talks about Linting.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:34 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:39 – Chris: If it’s not the default then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:55 – Divya: When you manually setup your project you can run a prettier pre-commit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:00 – Chris: My pre-commits are much more thorough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:37 – <i>Panel goes back-and-forth!</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s4">29:26 <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s5">– Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:02 – Panel: Can you talk about <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org"><span class="s5">VuePress,</span></a> please?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:06 – Guest: Yeah! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest talks about </i><a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org"><span class="s5"><i>VuePress</i></span></a><i> in-detail!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:21 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:25 – Panel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:44 – Chuck: I am curious about this – what’s the difference between <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org"><span class="s5">VuePress</span></a> and <a href="https://nuxtjs.org"><span class="s5">Nuxt</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:58 – Guest answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:19 – <i>Chris adds his comments into this topic (</i><a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org"><span class="s5"><i>VuePress</i></span></a><i> and </i><a href="https://nuxtjs.org"><span class="s5"><i>Nuxt</i></span></a><i>).</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:47 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:02 – Divya.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:24 – Chuck: If they are fluent in English and native in another language and it’s easy to figure where to put everything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:41 – Chris: Yeah they have a clear path for to clear up any documentation potential problems. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:04 – Chris: ...the core docs and the impending libraries and the smaller ones, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:17 – Divya: When you are creating the docs and you are thinking about NTN it’s important to think about the English docs. They say that it’s best to think of the language if that doc was to be translated into another language.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">35:50 – Chris: Definition: “A function that returns another function” = higher function. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">36:19 – Chuck: We are running out of time, and let’s talk about user-scripts. You have co-organized a group in Washington D.C. I tell people to go to a group to help like Meetups. What do you recommend?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:00 – Guest: A lot of it is to be that community leader and show-up. To figure out let’s go ahead and meet. I know a lot of people worry about the “venue,” but go to a public library or ask an office for space, that’s an option, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:15 – Panel: We have these different <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s5">Meetups</span></a> and right now in my area we don’t have one for Vue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:37 – Guest: Yeah, I recommend just getting it going. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:04 – Chris: Yeah, just forming a community. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:16 – Chuck: D.C. is a large area, so I can see where the larger market it would be easier. But even for the smaller communities there can be 10 or so people but that’s a great start! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:48 – Guest: Yeah, once it gets started it flows.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:02 – Chuck: What are the topics then at these meetings? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:05 – Guest: I like to help people to code, so that’s my inspiration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:50 – Divya: I help with the Chicago <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s5">Meetup</span></a> and tons of people sign-up but not a lot of people to show – that’s our challenge right now! How do you get people to actually GO!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:44 – Guest: I tell people that it’s a free event and really the show up rate is about 30%. I let the people to know that there is a beginning section, too, that there is a safe place for them. I find that that is helpful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">42:44 – Chris: Yeah, even the language/vocabulary that you use can really deter people or make people feel accepted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">43:48 – Chuck: Let’s talk about the idea of ‘new developers.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would ask people for the topics that THEY wanted to talk about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">44:37 – Divya: From an organizer’s perspective...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:10 – Chuck: If you want people to show-up to your Meetups just do this...a secret pattern!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I did a talk about a block chain and we probably had 3x to 4x a better turnout. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">46:55 – Panel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">47:00 – Divya: The one event that was really successful was having Evan and Chris come to Chicago. That event was eventually $25.00 and then when Evan couldn’t come the price dropped to $5.00.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:00 – <i>Panel goes back-and-forth.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">48:22 – Chuck: Where can they find you?</span></p>
