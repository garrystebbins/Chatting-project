<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In this episode, the panel talks amongst themselves on the topic: how does one contribute to opensource work? They discuss the various ways that they contribute, such as speaking at conferences, recording videos for YouTube, podcasting, among others. Check-out today’s episode to get some insight and inspiration of how YOU can contribute to YOUR community! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:11 – We have decided we haven’t completed this topic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:23 – Last time we went around the panel and see how we contribute? One of the ways I contribute to opensource is organizing events and conferences. Divya, you write some code – a little bit?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:05 – Divya.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:11 – Panelist: Divya, you speak at conferences, write blog posts, and code. Super top-secret project? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:33 – Divya: I am trying to grow. Maybe I can talk about the secret project later?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:56 – Panelist: Yes, I contribute through videos and education. I’ve tried in the past seeing issues in opensource, but I find that I am better at teaching. Charles you run a Vue Podcast?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:29 – Chuck: Yeah, that’s what they say. I work on the podcasts, online conferences, eBooks, and online summits. Lastly, Code Badges that is on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com"><span class="s2">Kickstarter.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">4:06 – Panelist: How we can contribute to opensource and still make a living. What is free and what we charge for? Finding a balance is important – we covered that last time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">How to get into opensource in a variety of ways: How do you start speaking at conferences? How to you write code for opensource? Divya, how do they start? Do you need a public speaking degree?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">5:29 – Divya: It might help. To get started with public speaking – it’s deceptively easy but then it’s not at the same time. You submit a proposal to a conference and it’s either accepted or declined. You have to learn how to CRAFT your ideas in a CFP to show the panel that this topic is RELEVANT to the conference and that you are an expert. It’s not the speaking that’s the hard part it’s the writing of the proposal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:00 – Panelist: You have talked about CFP – what is that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:09 – Divya: It’s a Call For Papers (CFP). It’s just a process of being accepted at a conference. Sometimes conferences have an open call – where they might have a Google form or some software to fill out some details. They will ask for your personal details, a short draft, the title of your talk, and a longer description (why you should be the speaker, etc.). It’s a multi-step process. Even though YOU are the right person to talk about X topic – you don’t have to be – you just have to SOUND like you know what you are talking about. Show that you’ve done your researched, and that you have some understanding. Also, that you are capable of presenting the information at the conference. That’s what I mean by being “THE BEST” person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:33- Charles: They aren’t looking always for the expert-level of explaining X topic. Even if it’s at the basic level that’s great. If you can deliver it well then they might pick your proposal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">I have spoken at a number of conferences, and I started talking at Meetups. Most organizers are desperate for people to give talks. If you talk at these informal settings – then you get feedback from </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:47 – Divya: Yes, lightning talks are great for that, too. This way you are flushing out what you do and don’t want to talk about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:07 – Charles: A lot of people don’t realize that they are good speakers. The way to get better is to do it. I am a member of Toast Masters. You gain experience by talking at many different events. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:23 – Panelist: I don’t know much about Toast Masters – what is it? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">12:29 – Charles: Toast Masters, yes, they collect dues. As you sit in the meeting you have time to give feedback and get feedback. They have a “MM” master, and a grammatical master, and another specialist that they give you feedback. It’s a really constructive and friendly environment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">13:42 – I’ve been to Toast Masters and the meetings are early in the morning. 7:00 or 7:30 AM start time. Everything Chuck just said. I went to a couple and they don’t force you to talk. You can go just to see what it’s about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:21 – Charles makes more comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:48 – Meetups is a great way to get into the community, too. What if Toast Masters sounds intimidating, and you don’t think you can speak at a Meetup just, yet. Are there more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:18 – You can be the town crier. Stand on the soapbox and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:32 – There is someone sitting on a soapbox and screaming to a crowd.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">15:43 – Chuck: You can do a YouTube video or a podcast, but I think getting the live feedback is super important. <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org"><span class="s2">Toastmasters</span></a> are so friendly and I’ve never been in front of a hostile crowd. You get up and they are rooting for you. It’s not as scary as you make it out to be. You aren’t going to ruin your reputation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:48 – Local Theater! That helps a lot, to me, because you have lines to read off of the script. You are a character and you get to do whatever you want. Also, teaching really helps. You don’t have to be a professional teacher but there are volunteer areas at a local library or your community centers and libraries. Find opportunities!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">18:18 – Divya: Improvisation is good for that, too, back to Chris’ point. Improvisation you don’t have the lines, but it forces you to think on the spot. It helps you practice to think on the spot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:04 – Teaching is good for that, too. It makes you think on the spot. You have to respond on the fly. Life teaching is Improvisation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:31 – Charles: You learn the patterns that work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:57 – Panelist: There are some websites that can track your CFP due dates. You can apply to talk to 5-6 different conferences. You pitch the same idea to 5-6 conferences and you are bound to get picked for at least 1 of those conferences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:51 – Divya: There is an account that tweets the CFP due dates that are closing in 1-2 weeks. Check Twitter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:25 – Chuck: Take your CFP and have someone else look at it. I know a bunch of conference organizers and ask them for their feedback. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">21:48 – Title and description need to be there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">22:48 – Divya: Look at past events to see what was already done in past conferences. This is to see what they are kind of looking for. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Divya talks about certain conferences and their past schedules. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:52 – Eric was saying earlier that you could send in more than 1 proposal. Another one suggests sending in 3 proposals. Someone would love to accept you, but say there is someone else you beats you by a hair.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">24:31 – Divya: The CFP process is usually blind and they don’t “see” you until later. Most conferences try to do this so there is no bias. They will ask for no name, but only focusing on content. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">25:28 – Sarah May has some great suggestions. Look at the show notes under LINKS. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">25:57 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s2">Advertisement – Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:34 – We have talked about how you submit your proposals. Maybe let’s transition into another topic, like education. Eric – do you have any tips into writing blog posts and such?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:36 – Eric: Find a topic that you want to learn and/or you are expert on. Going out there and putting out content for something you are learning. If you get something wrong then someone will probably call you out. Like <a href="https://www.reddit.com"><span class="s2">Reddit</span></a> you might get more criticism then vs. your own blog. I look for topics that interest me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:30 – Panelist: How do you get people to see it? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:40 – Eric: Consistency – sharing on your social media channels. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></span><span class="s3">, Frontend, and/or other sites. I’m doing this for myself (first), and secondary I am teaching other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:23 – Getting feedback from people is great.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:40 – Eric: It’s a process to build that audience, build quality content, and keep up with it. Facebook groups – hey I put this content out there. Another way you can do it is work with a publisher and try going to a site called <a href="https://twitter.com/pluralsight?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s2">PluralSite.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:47 – Do you have to be famous, like Joe, to get onto their site?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:09 – Chuck: The audition process I got screwed on. They ask you to record a video, fix anything in the video, and then they will tell you if they will accept your courses or not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:37 – People who will distribute your content, there is a screening process. Guest blog, too, will get your name out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:23 – Chuck: You just have to be a level above the reader. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:37 – Odds are that you can explain it better than someone who learned it 5 years ago. Even if it’s a basic JavaScript thing that you JUST learned, who cares put it out there. If you made X mistake then I’m sure thousands of other developers have made the same mistake. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:17 – Twitter is a great platform, too. A short and sweet Tweet – show them your main idea and it can get </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:01 – <i>Comments.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:04 – I use Ghost for my blogging platform. You can start off on Wordpress and others write on Medium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:25 – Divya: I like to own my own content so I don’t write on Medium anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:40 – I like my content on my OWN site. That’s why I haven’t been using Medium anymore. There are more pop-ups and such, too, so that’s why I don’t like it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:06 – Divya: If you don’t want to start up your own site, Medium is nice. Other users pick it up, which is an easy way to spread content right away. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:13 – Chuck: Some of them will pay you for that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:23 – <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo"><span class="s2">Sarah Drasner</span></a> on the Vue team is an editor of <a href="https://css-tricks.com"><span class="s2">CSS tricks</span></a>. Good way to get your content out there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">37:48 – Divya:<a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo"><span class="s2"> Sarah</span></a> will work with you. Not only do you get access to put content out there, but then you get feedback from <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo"><span class="s2">Sarah</span></a>, too!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:19 – Remember if you are doing a guest post – make sure to put out solid examples and good content. You want to put time and effort into it, so put more </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:02 – Any more advice on educational content?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:11 – Chuck: I am always looking for guests for the podcasts and topics. You reach out and say I would like to be a guest on such and such a show. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:39 – I thought back in the day – oh those podcast hosts are for THOSE famous people. They must have some journalism degree, and here I AM! It apparently is not that bad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:19 – Chuck: When I was coding semi-professionally for 1 year and my friend Eric Berry (Teach Me To Code – website) he was looking for someone to record videos for him. I submitted a video and I just walked through how to do basic routing. Basic for Ruby on Rails users, and I said that this is my first video. I tweeted that information. Screen Flow reached out to me because I mentioned their name, and I got a license and a microphone to help me record my videos! That gave me the confidence to start podcasting. It’s scary and I’m thinking I will screw this up, I don’t have professional equipment, and look at me now!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:46 – To be a podcast host it isn’t much. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">42:55 – Chuck: I am trying to make podcasting easier. The hard part is preparing the content, get it edited, getting it posted. It’s all the other stuff. Recording and talking isn’t that bad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:28 – What are my steps if I want to start a new podcast?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:39 – What microphone should I get?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">43:48 - $100-$130 is the Yeti microphone. Do I need a professional microphone? People can’t tell when guests talk on their iPhone microphone or not. Especially if you already have those then you won’t be out if you don’t want to continue with podcasting. Record for free with Audacity. Have something to talk about and somewhere to post it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:01 – Panelist asks Chuck more questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:13 – Divya.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">45:29 – It’s easier if everyone is in the same room. If the sound quality is good enough then people will stay, but if the quality is poor then people will go away. I recommend Wordpress - it’s super easy. You can host on Amazon, but if you will host long-term then use <a href="https://support.libsyn.com/kb/itunes/"><span class="s2">Libsyn</span></a> or <a href="https://create.blubrry.com/manual/podcast-promotion/submit-podcast-to-itunes/"><span class="s2">Blubrry</span></a>. Great platforms will cost you less then some others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">46:58 – iTunes?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">47:04 – <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/"><span class="s2">Podcast through iTunes</span></a> you just give them a RSS feed. All you do is fill out some forms. Submit that and it will run – same for Google Play. You might want to get some artwork. In the beginning for me I got a stock image – edited it – and that was it. One I got one of my headshots and put the title on there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:06 – Then when people will hear this...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:23 – Summary: microphone, content, set up <a href="https://wordpress.com/create/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=277412335406&amp;campaignid=998785131&amp;adgroupid=53026924047&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;sgmt=gb&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=Google_WPcom_Search_Brand_Desktop_US_en&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=277412335406&amp;campaignid=998785131&amp;adgroupid=53026924047&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;targetid=kwd-295456403946&amp;locationid=9027307&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_fPJ-IWJ3gIVklp-Ch1PKAKREAAYASAAEgIUjPD_BwE"><span class="s2">WordPress</span></a>, submit it to iTunes, and record frequently. Keep improving.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">48:46 – Anything you are doing anything online – make sure your mantra is “this is good enough.” If you spend tons of hours trying to perfect it – you might drive yourself crazy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">49:18 – Not everyone will enjoy podcasting or <a href="https://www.youtube.com"><span class="s2">YouTubing</span></a> – so make sure you don’t invest a lot of money at first to see where you are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:06 – Educational content topic continued. Contributing to coder depositories. What’s the best way to get into that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">50:28 – Chuck: Some will say: This one is good for a newbie to tackle. You just reach out – don’t just pick it up and tackle it – I would reach out to the person first. Understand what they need and then work on it, because they might have 2 other people working on it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">51:11 – Divya: <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com"><span class="s2">Hacktoberfest</span></a> – Digital Ocean – they publish opensource projects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">52:22 – Yeah check it out because you can get a free t-shirt! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">53:50 – Chuck: Doing the work that the hotshots don’t want to do. It helps everyone out, but it might not be the most glamorous job. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">55:11 – Spelling mistakes – scan the code base. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">55:43 – Divya: If you do small contributions that people DON’T want to do – then these contributors will see you and you will be on their radar. You start building a relationship. Eventually people will start giving you more responsibilities, etc. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">56:59 – Chuck: I have seen people been contributors through Ruby on Rails. They got the gig because the core team sees your previous work is reliable and good work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:26 – Is there a core contributor guideline?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:37 – Good question. If Divya likes you then you are in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">57:47 – It’s Evan who makes those decisions, but we are working on a formal guideline. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">58:52 – Will they kick you out?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">59:00 – Unless they were doing bad stuff that means pain for other people you won’t get kicked out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">59:33 – Representing Vue to some degree, too. The people who are representing Vue are apart of it. We are trying to get a better answer for it, so it’s complicated, but working on it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:00:02 – How did you get on the team? Well, I was contributing code, I was discussing ways to better x, y, and z. Evan invited me to come into the core team. Basically he did it so he wouldn’t have to keep babysitting us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:06 – Chuck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:20 – Panelist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:01:48 – Panelist: One of our core team members got his job because he was answering questions from the community. He is not a software developer by training, but his background is a business analyst. You don’t have to contribute a ton of code. He was a guest so check out the past episode. See show notes for links. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:03:05 – Chuck: We need to go to picks and I think that topic would be great for Joe!</span></p>
