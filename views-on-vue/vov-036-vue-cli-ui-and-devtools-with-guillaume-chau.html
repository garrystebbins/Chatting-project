<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:00 – <i>Chris lists who is on the panel along with today’s guest. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Chris: Who are you and what are you working on? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:50 – Guest: I am working on a startup in Paris. I am calling in from Lyon, France. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:12 – Panel: Late there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:15 – Panel: Almost time for dinner?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:21 – Guest: Yes, it’s cooking now!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:26 – <i>Panel asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:43 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:14 – Panel: Anyone who didn’t want to be an expert, they don’t’ have to worry about how things tie together – you could help them with their configurations?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:36 – Guest: A lot of the work is done for you with the configurations so you can start writing your apps. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:53 – Panel: How is 3 different from 2?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:06 – Guest: It’s like a new tool entirely. It’s working very different, too, with a different system. It has a different template base. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:53 – Panel: To combine templates you have to understand it well, like different Webpacks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:12 – Guest: Regarding Webpacks and their configurations...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:52 – Panel: With the template situation there was an issue where they would make their project and as new versions of Webpack came out...and new versions of Babble, and they will have to manage the dependencies of all of these. There might be some plugins that only work with x, y, and z. IT can be frustrating – can version 3 take care of this for you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:44 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:24 – Panel: How do you update plugins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:29 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:26 – Panel: Upgrade your plugins then as long as all of your plugins are the same version it’s okay?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:34 – <a href="https://twitter.com/Akryum?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s3">Guest:</span></a> Yes. You can upgrade your...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:38 – Chris: Divya, you just gave a talk (London) on...plugins, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:50 – Divya: Yes. We talked about Webpack configurations. For example, if there are some testing libraries you can essentially setup a UCLI plugin to create a test – create a test folder – plugins let you generate files or folders (structure your project in a certain way). <a href="https://vuejs.london/talks/"><span class="s3">In London I talked about server less functions with...</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:30 – Panel: Any kind of pattern you want to use in different applications you can wrap that up in a plugin?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:42 – Divya: Yes. Exactly. Instead of repeating yourself you can wrap it up. It’s really handy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:00 – <i>Panel asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:02 – Divya: You could do that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:10 – Panel: ...or a <a href="https://graphql.org"><span class="s3">graph QL</span></a> – Yes!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:20 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:33 – Chris: Any thing that third-party plugins don’t have access to?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:43 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:54 – Chris. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:08 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:25 – Divya: ...if you want a UCLI service...and so you can grab those commands and add-on those commands and using those default commands. You have access to those commands, so you don’t always...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:02 – Chris: Like deploy?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:11 – Divya: Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:17 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:19 – Divya. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Divya: Do you have strategies on how you go about testing your plugins?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:35 – Guest: Yes, I do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:23 – Panel: So this is like end-to-end test for a CLI tool?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:33 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:50 – Panel: Is there documentation for all of this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:59 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:14 – Divya: I think the way I’ve done tests is to edit an example a test project as a local dependency and then seeing that it works. I want to make sure that it works. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Divya: And the other way I’ve done it is VUE CLI it is undocumented at the moment. You can test your CLI plugin from within the plugin itself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:55 – Guest: I’ve used some of those before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:08 – Chris: Speaking of the UI that is something I’d love to talk about. It seems unique to me – a CLI tool that has a UI that is built along with it. That seems strange to some people – how does that work and WHY would you need it? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:42 – Guest: I’ll start with the WHY. It is way more powerful and as a greeter the API interface is more fixable so you can choose different options. For example when you create a project you can set different things. You basically have to name the project and you have simple options to choose form. Now it’s basically a really fixable system with plugins and stuff like that. I thought it would be nice to free it from the terminal. The best way to do that was creating a graphical interface. The main advantage of this was that you could add more information and explanations to what is going on. You can also create better interface. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Guest: Also, it currently improves discoverability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:30 – Chris: You could do a search in the UI and type in the name of something you are working with and then your plugin would show up in the list – and then it would just be added to their project. That’s nice so they don’t have to go to the NPM or doing the README.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:07 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:14 – Divya: I think it’s nice b/c I have used it extensively for my plugin. I want to see what hasn’t been taken already. I have a way of organizing my modules and I’ve used to it see what names have already been taken?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:47 – Guest: I think sometimes...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:15 – Divya: The feature that you are able to run tasks from the UI is nice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:55 – Chris: It sounds like it offers a nicer way to view a lot of things. One of the other advantages (that I found) is that I have a configuration to the listing rules to Vue – you can pick the exact rule set that you want to use. Normally when you look at a configuration file, you don’t know what rule sets are available, you don’t know what options are available. All of this you have to look at documentation. You can see descriptions of what each rule does. You can do so much in the UI. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:25 – Chris: Do they still need a terminal?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:35 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:41 – Chris: That would be cool!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">32:46 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:09 – Chris: They still need a little terminal knowledge right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:15 – Guest: Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:33 – Chris: They need a little terminal knowledge, they need to install the package, then they need to run VUE UI, then they can do anything from the terminal inside of the UI?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:55 – Guest: You can create and import existing projects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:28 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:33 – Chris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:36 – Panel: It’s already active?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:43 – Guest: I would like to talk about what I did in London. That conference I talked about...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:00 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:07 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:20 – Panel: Nice!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">37:25 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Guest: All of these widgets that I talked about you can use the product API and do anything that you want. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">38:47 – Chris: If someone wants to see the dashboard that you are doing – where can they see that stuff?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:00 – Guest: GitHub. Follow the manuscript instructions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:16 – Chris: Your London talk was recorded?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:22 – Guest: Yes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:27 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:38 – Divya: Are you planning on giving this talk in other events?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:47 – Guest: Maybe not anytime soon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">39:56 – Chris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:00 – Divya.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:09 – Guest: It might be release already we don’t know. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:15 – Divya: A date you would like to release by?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:25 – Chris: Where can people support you and your work?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">40:35 – Guest: Yes, they definitely can. You can check out the GitHub file. Also, check-out my open source work, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">41:17 – Chris: Twitter?</span></p>
