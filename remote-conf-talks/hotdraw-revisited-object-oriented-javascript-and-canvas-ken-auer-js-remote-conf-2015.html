<p>In the late 80s, Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham came up with HotDraw (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HotDraw), a two-dimensional graphics framework for structured drawing editors, originally written in Smalltalk-80. Since then, many implementations have been created, and the principles applied in a lot of places. While a lot has been learned, the original HotDraw still outshines many of its successors.</p>

<p>In the last few years, RoleModel Software was asked to build several systems with a complex underlying model where the user input was primarily direct graphical manipulation. This included:</p>

<p>* a system to support educational innovators at the Friday Institute, using direct manipulation tasks to test and teach various mathematical concepts to elementary age children.</p>

<p>* a deck designer for decks.com, to design and produce a 3D rendering, materials lists, and permit-ready plans to help do-it-yourselfers get professional designs in seconds.</p>

<p>The solution in both cases included a HotDraw-like JavaScript approach to drawing and direct manipulation on an HTML5 Canvas, almost completely test driven using Jasmine.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll go over the highlights of the cool technical feats and show how JavaScript is not just for manipulating the DOM.</p>
