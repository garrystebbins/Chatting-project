<p>Rubyists are famously polyglot. I&#39;ve heard people joke that there are more JavaScript talks at some Ruby conferences than there are Ruby talks. But there&#39;s one area in which most Rubyists don&#39;t go: low-level programming. We often say &quot;Ruby is slow, but that doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll just drop down to C when I need performance.&quot; But C is pretty scary, so we never actually do it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this talk, Steve will show off Rust, a new programming language from Mozilla. Steve will show you how that saying should change: &quot;drop down to Rust,&quot; and why it&#39;s better for Rubyists than C.</p>
