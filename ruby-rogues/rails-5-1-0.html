<h2><strong>Rails 5.1.0</strong></h2>
On today's episode, Charles and David discuss about <strong>Rails 5.1.0</strong>. The new release is moving the community towards front-end JavaScript. Starting a Vanilla application has even become more convenient with Yarn and Webpack support. Tune in to this exciting talk to learn more!
<blockquote>“It's a great move forward without compromising what Rails stands for and its overall integrity—to give you the option to choose where you want to go while still maintaining the convention of configuration.” -David Kimura</blockquote>
<h2><b>Yarn Support in Rails</b></h2>
The new release comes with Yarn support. Yarn works as a package manager, that allows easy installation of other packages or JavaScript libraries into the Rails app.

It can also be used to maintain and update the different versions. Overall, having Yarn in Rails 5 provides more convenience than looking for the source outside and pulling it in.
<h2><strong>Yarn vs NPM</strong></h2>
According to a blog post by Rails, the new release is set “to manage JavaScript dependencies from NPM via Yarn.” As David explains it, Yarn serves like a bundler while NPM serves at the backend. But, he is not so sure about the difference.

On Charles' end, what he knows is that NPM includes a dependency management. Although both Charles and David don't agree with everything they've put up, the Rails core team has never failed to provide solid and good reasons for their releases.
<h2><strong>Convenience with Webpack</strong></h2>
The Webpack support also makes things convenient. Charles loved it when Rails adopted copy script, but felt he had better options.

As he moved away, he found it difficult to integrate his options. With Webpack, he can now pull up a plugin and simply ensure Webpack does its job.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:00] Music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:06] Episode 305 of the roads podcast this week on our panel we have Dave camera.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:14] How's it going I'm Charles Max with DevChat. TV I just want to quickly shut out about Ruby remote-com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we're talking about rails one or 5.1.0.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave you put the other video on Roofing Ruby about this you want to kind of give us a thumbnail sketch and get us going on what we're discussing here.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[0:36] Yeah reels 5108 it's a huge update,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah I really think that this is one they're bigger releases that they've done you other than that major versions that I mean they've included so many different things as well as deprecated a lot of different methods of the biggest things now that I know that the community that were,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tenant moving towards or the community,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">just kind of what they have seem to like us know a lot more JavaScript front and stuff and now with the additions of stuff like yarn and webpack,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it makes it a lot easier to start off a vanilla rails application,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">which is a kind of baked in an included know and they've added a lot more things I'm excited to talk about today and I think it's a great move forward without compromising the,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what rail stands for and it's an overall Integrity know to kind of give you the option to choose the direction that you want to go while still maintaining the convention of configuration,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">or convention over configuration yes so one thing that I just want to talk about here for a second is.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to that that idea around JavaScript in that front and JavaScript you know given that this is a web framework in the direction that the wave is going I mean this is really exciting that they are moving in this direction where you can now actually,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">: packages for web applications and then you know you something like web Pactiv to build stuff.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:10] I was felt like the asset pipeline work but it was a little bit clunky and it's nice that they're just adopting some open source software that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much a lot of the rest of the web uses and then getting all the goodies that come with that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[2:26] Yeah absolutely this is Charles Max just wanted to talk to you really briefly about freelancer.com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm putting on a conference for people who want to go freelance or who are freelance and bringing in some of the experts from the freelancer show to talk to you about how to find clients how to collect money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build your business how to specialize and much much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're thinking about going freelance or you're already freelance and want to hear from the experts on house to go become a.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grow your freelancing business then by all means come check us out a freelancer milk.com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[3:07] Goodies that come with that yeah absolutely,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and the idea with yarn and one the really cool things about it in for the lister's you don't know yarn is just saying it's kind of like Butler for JavaScript where it's just a package manager so you can easily install other.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Packages are JavaScript libraries into your rails application like full calendar or any other kind of jobs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript library with these and you can also use it to maintain and update the different versions so,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">they've definitely made it a lot nicer than having to go out find that Library source,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">food into your vendor assets and then yeah we do everything no work no then run your system test they made it much more integrated now that's why I really like I've been quite drink their webpack Kool-Aid yet,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it's okay if he has so has some issues with it but you know that's neither here nor later but we'll see what happens with it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really like webpack I've been using it with angular stuff for a while and then it's it's pretty awesome.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know you just pulling what you need and then you run it and it seems to generally work I mean there are a lot of config options you know there's a huge surface area to the API.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It it has some plug-ins for pretty much everything you need to do with it so it's a nice way to go there I'm curious though I haven't used yarn so what's the difference between yarn and then p.m.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[4:43] I don't know if there is a,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">any kind of major difference that you need to well I guess yard as maybe just the front end or a kind of the interface for using npm no,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm not really too much of a JavaScript guy to really be able to notice the door know the difference but on the change log or on the Block does that they have no the first point is to manage JavaScript dependencies from in pmba yarn,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so it sounds like yarn is kind of like your Butler and mpm is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">just kind of the back inside of things yeah but npm includes dependency management,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and so that that's kind of where I'm it does it does which is kind of strange you know now it's are until someone actually like call something out or set something do I really something like yeah what is going on there,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">know and honestly to date of the Rails core team has never failed me,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and while I do not agree with everything that they do in some instances I think for the most part when they do introduce a big new technology into their,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Horror core rails app that it's usually pretty solid and good.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[6:08] Yep yeah I mean I agree I mean there's some areas that I just.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby do stuff and I'm just like okay but then another areas you know that they generally have the right of things,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you know in until I move on to something else so what one example is coffee scripture example I loved it when they adopted coffeescript but I felt like there have been other options that are.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At least better for me that have come out since then primarily es6 and typescript and so you know is a move away from that sometimes it's not as easy to integrate some other options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that's one of the things that I'm really excited about with,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">using something like is that webpack like I said has all those plug-in so integrating that stuff is just a matter of pulling in the typescript plug-in and then making sure that the webpack build.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does what it's supposed to do and I think one of my main issues with webpack,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">with how they have an integrated into the rails application right now,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">in the speedo where I guess now it's a release candidate won at the time of this recording is that yet to run a separate incense or separate server to actually be able to serve out those assets and I think that's kind of you know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">especially when start working on a much larger application where you need to be testing your background job so you can maybe have a sidekick running then you have a red a server than you have,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">no question database server running your rails application now you have an extra component or do you have to have the webpack service running to serve your assets it just seems you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[7:49] I just one more thing that have to worry about almost that's kind of way.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen Bells 510 I've been completely bought into wet pack yet.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:02] Yeah I mean I think for the most part it works behind the scenes I haven't actually tried to integrate any these things into it but it appears to work primarily behind the scenes so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[8:13] I don't know how much configuration or me know how you need with webpack 2 to make things work at least in the the basic case.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oasis you want to configure it to do other things I mean you had to fill with rails to make it do yes 6 or.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Typescript or something else anyway and it didn't always work seamlessly so you know you may run into the some of the same issues but at least webpack is designed to handle that stuff.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah and I guess from that perspective you know it does,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">just work within rails 510 you know if you run the the webpack-dev-server so you know from that perspective you know yes it's a lot less trying to take her and get it to work now you don't have to worry about your initializer files or any kind of configurations that you just run the server and it work,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">San Fran that perspective now it is definitely much much nicer I guess I just see him one at all no I totally understand,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it was interesting though was that you can actually do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Webpack equals aren't on your options for dash dash webpack equals angler review or react and it'll actually pulling all the stuff that you need there yeah,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">that is really cold so I think that's going to for those who are still no really sold on the actionview I think this is going to kind of be a case where,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">if it's that simple to get up and running with few or react or angular within a new rails application that might be a push for more developers to try out these JavaScript Frameworks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:55] Yeah I agree.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[9:58] And I mean the way that I've done angular in the past is angular has its own CLI and so I would just generate a separate angular app.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then it would run all that stuff and then I would just tell it how to talk to a railsback end so the fact that I can actually spin up an angular front end,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and the rails back-end and kind of have it all automatically talk to each other cuz it was kind of tricky sometimes to make it talk to the back in the way I wanted.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes it really seamless for that yeah and then you have everything kind of in one ice,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I repo you don't have to worry about managing two separate things or whatever so yeah it is pretty cool,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah I'm previous Ruby rug got this as I kind of said I had this dream about you Jas I'm not so have that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conviction to try it out haven't had time yet been busy building a deck now like that actual wooden deck which is a whole nother story but it all comes down to power tools men,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so yeah so yeah the whole JavaScript stuff that came in 510 has been pretty amazing,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">then also dropping the support for the default,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">jQuery as a dependency you I think is pretty you just specially if you're trying to really get to hit no hit that sub 100 millisecond response or even the first.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:29] The first request no letting up those assets know if you don't need them in there than reducing that I said js5000 size,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah I can definitely be pretty big I don't know what jQuery comes in as a identified size but I guess benefind in Jesus,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but now it's so awesome overhead so having that night as a default dependency anymore is pretty cool.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah that made me happy I mean it's funny because I remember when I first started doing web development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was shortly before or shortly after Jake. Come out until we were doing stuff with prototype JS and then.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all this is so nice and it's funny to me now that it's like oh yeah I don't have to worry anymore.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[12:16] Yeah I remember that prototype days and no maybe that's when I started to really hate,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript just as a whole no I had some bad bad experiences with the Prototype back in the day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah but it's you know it it's getting better and better and you know was you pulling some of these Frameworks like reactor Angela review they handle a lot of the dumb Frost,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the stuff that you don't really need to know or don't need to want to know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">for you and they do it without jQuery in so if you're pulling in and angular or reactor if you it just.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know it does the right thing for you and so yet not having that monolithic Library cuz it it is a fairly large Library.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what does cut down on that band with that you're taking up and the other thing is is that by not loading a large file like jquery-ui jQuery UI into your application especially on mobile which.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounts for more and more traffic on the web these days you know it just makes it that much faster and easier and so that with that was definitely a big plus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[13:27] Yeah yeah absolutely and if you're not going to find Angie zipping at the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your assets you're definitely doing something wrong there you know he says you're a CSS nsj files go so I mean that right there is going to be your biggest bang for the buck and it's free today too,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah well the other thing is is that if you using webpack it has plug-ins for tree shaking.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then that'll also make your beer deliverable smaller I'm not sure if you're familiar with pre shaking.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that kind of like a on CSS for JavaScript or just remove the unused functions yeah basically okay so yeah it's.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It only works if you're using es6 variant so he has six or transcript.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can go in and because of the way that the modules are written and loaded.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It'll go through and it'll actually pick out all of the different pieces that you're not using so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as I know it doesn't work it doesn't work well with extra 5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so you know copy script compile survive it doesn't go through any S6 system and so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will work out as well but there's a system out there called the roll up there's a JavaScript jabber episode on roll up and it explains what retaking isn't works been so I'll put a link to that in the show notes but yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So that mean again coming back to webpack there are all these options you can pull in and it has a couple of tree shaking plugins you can hook up and it'll reduce that compiled Javascript file size that much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:07] That's cool yeah I have to look into that more cuz I always like no trying to get my application to perform as fast as possible even on the first request that definitely sounds like you know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you can almost blindly just pull in the know who bootstrap JavaScript library and then just kind of have it automatically trim down what's not being used,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah yeah yeah there a lot of these Frameworks that like bootstrap tour jQuery or in reserve Foundation or some of these others that yeah,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">no you're not using all the features I load them up to the user and why make them you know pay to wait for that file download.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[15:50] Yeah it so we're not going we're not all all in a gigabit connection snow come on it's 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah well I'm just waiting for the new new version of cellular networks come out where we do have against a really fast speeds well don't know what.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can't wait well and I think it's it's funny cuz you know to wax a little bit maybe political for a second.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are going to up in arms somewhere the over things over things like mint neutrality and I think honestly if if it was kind of ubiquitous why the internet pipe kind of access.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a lot of those concerns would go away because you would just you would never max out to the point where you're actually coming up against somebody else using up bandwidth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we just don't know you're going to make whatever service faster well you know prioritize away because.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know unless you're throttling somebody it just won't matter.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[16:57] Yeah I agree and then I don't know all the Shady corporate stuff that goes on I don't know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hate it don't like some some companies I won't name them just because I don't know for absolute but I heard that they will uncapped your bandwidth,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I forgive you like your full speed one like speedtest.net,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Advance Auto in other areas such as such crap why would you do that that's not nice anyway I let us on doing tangent talk about on so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yeah yeah but I agree with you on that so yeah so we talked a lot about the JavaScript stuff is there anything else related to the front in that we should.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know hit on this another area.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well are they did unify form pack and form for they kind of bonded income or with witches,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Konica yeah it kind of takes the guesswork of do I need use for Integra form for in these situations personally I use simple form some forms for most my things so it's not,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it doesn't really matter too much but I'll still find myself using form tag for something like this I swear I'm not actually referencing a model with that form.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:19] But I think now just having a big clean a code and so that's definitely a cool thing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah I agree in infamy it's like look I want a form and let me just tell you what the form is about instead of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Old form for form with a which ones which were form for and form tag.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[18:43] So that it definitely is a welcome change email also having the apartment as mailers no I think that's just going to make the whole mailing pipeline,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">much much more drain cleaner,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so have you read up on that much I looked at it I didn't quite see how to call it as opposed to so calling it with parameters.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah so you know when you can reduce the number of parameters that you're requiring 4-H maylard,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">right now you're going to send out and you can have her before action which will basically said that instance variables for all of the different common things but,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am having a passing the Predators from your controller or your background job and to the mailer it has access to the perimeters holding the prince from that was the part I was clear on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah so that's that's kind of cool you know,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I do see where it kind of opens it up to where you can make some more mistakes or get some errors in your app that you wouldn't normally cuz you were explicitly setting the parameters but I think it's some.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah it should be an interesting move forward yeah I completely agree in it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me just simplifying that much and then like you've mentioned of the before actions works like,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">a walk and I kind of got some done some default things or I know I'm going to want it to set up off of the parameters for all of these are most of these different melee options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:23] I mean is that just simplify sat on the stuff.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuz I'm the stuff that I need to do one set up for everything yeah just happens and then the stuff that is different than I just run that in the method and then tell it which template to run.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[20:36] Yeah yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess my biggest gripe with this release candidate 510 is just all the deprecation that they've done no one can see it's important take,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">clean up some of the Legacy code and the real score I think that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">this side this release is going to break a lot more applications than you even upgrading to rails 5 from 4.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No I'm,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">there's a lot of gems that were using deprecated methods and stuff that I think we're going to have some issues upgrading even from reels 52510 so when a grievance of the whole,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">relais I would be yet you know I wish I had some kind of better,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">better way of moving off the deprecated methods over into maybe a separate gym or something where you can still access them so you can slowly upgrade to a new version but.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now they can adjust.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Took it away and now you have to go back and fix Jen's or Smith pull request for other gems which isn't a bad thing to keep the help get those maintain its kind of annoying annoying.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah well maybe somebody will write a gym that puts them all back and then throws warnings or something at you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah or maybe you can load the gym and then you know make some kind of setup call that says start throwing me errors after this date or something I don't know.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[22:11] But it it yeah I don't know I mean a lot of those are things that I used to.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know like the render text and you know some of the other you know things that they pulled out of there I was just like wow that's kind of been core and been there for ever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah yeah which I can I can see you all are there reasons for never getting a lot of those,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so they have some kind of fallback plan to where you can slowly migrate go so at least you're on the latest version of rails you're just so using some not even security,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">related issues but you know you're still using some of the old deprecated methods just cuz you haven't had time to update a gym or your application but you're so getting the latest security fixes and all that stuff,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you coming from a more unsupported version of rails or something is there a full list of the deprecated methods.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't think so I'll release you if you go to the changelogs for each one of the different main packages.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can kind of see them in the changelog know that might be a good list compiled just so you can easily search through it but.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah maybe I have to write a blog post yeah that could be interesting but anyway.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm just I'm looking through the change log just to see and most of these are things that they've.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:46] Editor changed as opposed to things that they pulled out so yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah I'm not I'm not seeing a list of things that we're actually deprecated so yeah I don't I don't know.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:59] It definitely be interesting to to see.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:04] Yeah that was a lot of stuff removed from action support so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah well and that's going to affect more things than just rails because there are a lot of systems out there these actors work because they just assume that you know people are used to the rails so they won all those goodies in Ruby.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">General and so other gems and other systems pull that in so should be interesting but yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[24:36] Yeah. Hey everybody this is Charles Max what I just wanted to talk to you really briefly about yes or no.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we just pick speakers things are looking really good and we're really excited to cover a broad range of topics for JavaScript Avella person so if you're looking to learn things about nodejs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">About becoming a better developer about deployment about mobile development and much more and much more about JavaScript income check is out yes or no contact.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you can also find it by going to Deb. TV / conferences and then picking the conference you want we have last year's recordings there we have this year's.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A conference coming up to make sure you get your ticket and we'll see you there interesting but yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[25:22] And I've been playing around with Capybara for a date yeah it's a kind of topics but there's some.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But sometimes 510 which is really cool yeah I really like that yeah I looked at that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched you're drifting Ruby video on it too and he kind of showed it off and that I mean if you've written copy Barra you know there's not a whole lot that's changed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But just the fact that it all sort of works and you don't have to go and.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know include coffee bar and then include the driver and then jump through all these hoops and then you know configure R-Spec in the make it all play nice you know it just kind of all does the right thing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That's super nice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah yeah absolutely and that's one more exciting things that yeah I found in rails 5 1.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It actually makes me kind of Wonder right test from applications now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So now I'm so bad I'm so bad about it you know I do on the mission critical,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">funny things but as far as any kind of accepted acceptance test with no like capybara or you know like ass llennium driver,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">tentacion I really don't do that too much now it's more just unit srr specks not really actually,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">pulling up the driver learning of web page and like kind of Step through the process so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:58] I don't know what are your what are your thoughts I'm like so bad about reading test cuz it's alright I have two hours I want to get this feature in,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">okay I'm done with the future crap out of time don't have time to write the acceptance test for it so,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">the animals have an afterthought sometimes as far as the system level test go I mean for those I generally just bright the happy path test.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because they take longer to run until I'm typically not going to run my systems test as part of my my regular test weed I usually just run in the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buena test and then an integration test and I need men usually those integration tests if they're you know.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal systems internal system and I just run them and if they connect to some external system then I'll run vcr and that way those are fast as well,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and when it comes down to the actual you know hit and run through it you know it it essentially has two virtualizer browser and it's just not this fast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[28:03] With those I'm not running them all the time and so it's like if it's not mission-critical it typically won't get one of those System test but.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah for me it's just the approach of hey what is this supposed to do.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And I like to write my test first because a lot of times I'm looking at I'm like okay how do I do this.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And so if I can start to characterize it a little bit and see if I put these things in and it should have these side effects in the output,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and that's typically where my test start and then it's okay so I need something that does this piece of this you know this piece of the process and so I'll jump in and write that part.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did actually.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does that part of the process and it's the same thing right given these inputs and these existing conditions outside of the method.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what are the side effects and what are the outputs and all those things and I just work through it that way over and over and over again but yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know people that write the system test for everything but typically what they do is they run that on there see I build before they deploy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah and then they also paralyzed their tests so that if it's an hour's worth of tests to be run and they have 4 quarters than it can run it 15 minutes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[29:25] Yeah.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Man riding running test it it is actually kind of fun you know and it kind of gives you that good fuzzy feeling that now yes the application is working as intended so it's all good.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep in some testing with the capybara I'm really excited to play Play-Doh play with that a lot more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah but they're just the fact that they cleaned a lot of that stuff up so you don't have to bang your head against the wall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just nice absolutely one other area that I saw that I was super excited about where the encrypted secrets.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I just thought you know you hear about these websites getting hacked,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and then you put all your secrets into the secrets that you know but it's a plain text file that you deploy to your server or,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">if you're not doing that then typically what you wind up doing is you either mind putting it in environment variables which if they can get on your machine they can ask the system for those if they know the names and the names are all is well so it's not that hard to figure out what.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what those are for the other thing is is.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know just the step of you know putting it in any way it is kind of convoluted so the fact that you can encrypt the secrets and then.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know you put the key on the machine and environment variable you can lock that down to some degree.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[30:55] And anyway makes it a whole lot simpler to keep the stuff that you want to keep secret secret even if somebody hops onto your machine and is able to you know login.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[31:06] Yeah that's definitely a cool aspect about it and I think from a development standpoint that's going to be really helpful just because you know I don't like have them my,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS keys in plain text you know if I,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">no just testing out my development machine because you can still do a lot of damage with that know if you got those,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so I think from that perspective it's really cool and for smaller shops this is definitely going to be a definitely a helpful tool because you don't have you ever deployed,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">new application only to have it crash because you didn't have a environment very bored something said yeah you forgot one of those so now you can kind of do it all in the development phase of things and I even had to worry about it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">telkonet expect it's pretty cool I think on the Enterprise level because once again into larger shops or where there's a lot more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kind of segregation of rolls,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you know people don't developers usually don't have access to production environments so in that case you know the devops team is having to give you the secrets to maintain,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">now within the rails application because it's going into this and Cryptid secrets so they're the devil's person is either going to have to pull down the rails application at it to Secrets file and then push up,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">make a merger request back into the rails application or they're going to have to give the key to the developer to do so I can see where.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[32:45] That kind of.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create starts and create some conflicting roles there and just managing the secrets but I think for the most part it's definitely a great move forward and it reminds me a lot of the ansible Vault,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ansible bolts is basically where you going to check into your good repo the secrets or passwords as well but it just stores it in a separate encrypted file if you don't have a key file you actually have to have a password that you type in,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and so it really works along much along the same lines except the secrets violin Broyles 510,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it requires you did kind of have like a console editor like the idea no Emax or whatever that it'll open up decrypt the following open it up and as soon as you can so you never have to worry about it,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">just kind of sitting out there in plain text yep.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Will and I just also remember the nightmare right of like setting up on Heroku even where you put everything into environment variables and seeing if it's okay well I have the database name in the database,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">user name in the database password and then I'm also running something over on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mongo hosting I don't remember what it is Mungo hq.com I think and so that I have like three or four keys for that and then I have in a couple of keys for AWS and I've got keys for you have like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:20] A dozen or two dozen of these things and yeah just to be able to put them all in one file and just look and check and know that they're all there and you know and then have them encrypted when you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Commit them to your repo so that there you don't have to do anything other than just a ploy it up and then make sure that the key is on the other end.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes that definitely is a definitely reduces arrest for human error which I think is a good thing and in many cases so yeah change.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep see what are the new things that have yeah there were a lot of,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">new features that didn't make it into the main blog post that you're kind of dug around and found in the chains logs and one of them what's the support and not so he's my comrade be quite a bit but the virtual columns and I think that's going to be pretty cool to wear,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what kind of place on to her other talk about the stored procedures that we had with the DB guy a few weeks ago Carlos.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah yeah sorry I couldn't remember his name but no being able to,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">upload from your rails application from doing some kind of calculations and putting on the sequel side you don't have any available just has a attribute,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you can call me what's up with in the Railside I think it makes a code a lot cleaner wild so giving you that performance boost in the flexibility.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[35:57] Premier sequel side.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:00] So that was a really cool thing I was excited to see that and then I can't wait to get in there and play around with that a bit more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah see I'm more on the postgresql or using something like Monday or something.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I it for me typically it's not as much of a thing that I'm getting excited about but at the same time just realizing that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[36:25] You know it it's there people need it and the lot of people are using MySQL and so I'm glad to see that they're supporting options and mainly for me the more options you have the you know the better you can.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve problems so now you have this other option can look at it and say what you know I really do need that feature in my skill someone to pick that instead of going with the postgres or something else.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah absolutely.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I find the most of these database options I mean they'll solve 18 + 90% of your problems any of them well just depending on how you want to structure your data and how you want to think about the way that it all connects.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But you know if there's one feature that one of them has that the other doesn't then you know it's nice to be able to pick that one and just make it work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am in a lot of ways it seems like.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[37:16] My sink was catching up with postgres and some of those kind of features or like a bicycle 5-7 added in the Json data type and stuff like that you know where you can,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">different data types of be able to sort your day to see that had to sort as a binary or something you have so that's pretty cool I just can't get over postgres is the search sensitivity and stuff like that that so just kind of bugs made just haven't,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">note to find a manual work around for those kind of things.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that like that bit me one time I'm like I hate those for his.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well if it matters then you don't use it and if it doesn't matter than you do right yeah but I do miss grass from not having used it is just a full text search,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">what's in there now and said I have to spend out like a elasticsearch service or something like that to go get that functionality.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[38:25] Yep absolutely yeah so just one of those things yet another thing in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't know how this is really going to affect my day today but just the change from a Reuben SAE Ruby no just for head person the RB files no I guess,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I don't know if it's going to be a speed increase on the application site but it's nice to see that they have dropped arubus and favor something that's currently supported,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">or maintained.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah I thought that was interesting I didn't realize that Aruba's had been abandoned for lack of a better term so just seeing that I was like oh okay I mean ultimately.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If it works I'm not that worried about it and you know if it's faster that's a bonus but I don't know how measurably.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:25] No different it's going to be so yeah I wasn't like I was just like okay.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[39:34] Yeah well it's good to see that the real score team is doing that kind of due diligence where they're making sure that they are using some kind of dependency that it is being maintained and it is going to be,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">inside kennel future-proofing so I do I do like that I like seeing that now that I'm so good as them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah well the other thing is is that I don't want to have to worry about well if it's not being maintained then.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:07] Does have security issues any cuz I'm going to my brain goes to the worst case scenario and the worst case scenario is is not being maintained to my giving you hacked.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[40:16] And the fact that I can just okay you know they're on to something that's maintained you know that that makes me happy yeah,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely a good move I can't think of any of the other things that they've added in but I know there's so much more but like the big highlight points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah absolutely well and you know the fact that they're still moving ahead I mean.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is there so much discussion around you know is Israel's going to still be relevant in you know people worried too about.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not you know ghh ghh is very opinionated and a lot of his opinions are things that people just don't agree with,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">or they feel like kind of hold railsback in some ways and so it's like okay well are they going to move ahead in ways that matter and I think this is a pretty clear shout out of,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">yeah they they get where things are going and this is a big step in that direction yeah,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">agree and I think that just because I want something and I would love to see it baked into the real score if it's not a globally beneficial change then it's going to hurt,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">rails more so in the long run if no we had that kind of stuff and so I think that he does try to keep a,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">does do a good job of trying to keep a objective mind on is it's going to be globally beneficial,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">to everybody or we can hit the masses as a global beneficial so I think that's know it's really tough to do sometimes you or at least take a very specific time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[41:57] And make an abstract enough to where it will be globally beneficial so yeah it's a tough job,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">absolutely alright well anything else that we should hit before we go to pics not that I can think of I mean.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had some good discussions there what thing did come to mind just briefly was the fact that I so I just switched I am no longer a Mac,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">person I guess you know I still have the MacBook Pro but I just set up a new a new desktop machine,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">and I just built it myself because it was way cheaper and I don't get the little canister with 10 million things hanging off of it you know the Mac Pro sit in my office and 99% of the time when I'm doing work or doing podcasts and so what I'm wondering is,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">is Duality work on Windows.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like if I go install rails 5 1 on Windows you know am I going to be able to install yarn am I going to be able to.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do some of these other things that are going to work on the yard runs on note so I'm assuming that it does.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But you know some of these other features are they going to work or am I kind of in trouble well you do have a couple options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh I would not consider installing rails on your actual Windows environment as a good option because chances are you could be hosting on a unique Style,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Debian sensor whatever else.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[43:30] But there is Bash for Windows which is available last year I think it was June and they're in one of their big updates in Windows 10 they added batch for Windows and.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I've been played around with that too much but it did it does look very promising and it's getting better and better yeah it's still a beta reader and yeah I mean I've I want up going to.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three different Microsoft developer conferences last year for JavaScript jabber they invited us out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And um yeah it's just been interesting to see that and I know that that's their I don't know though if it has like full-on lvm rgcc support.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know for building some extensions the.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rail sometimes depends on depending on what you're doing with it and I'm also not sure you know as far as tooling goes and things like that just exactly how that's going to work out I kind of want to set it up just to see.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hang ups are these days cuz I know that it's way better than you know 10 years ago when I started doing rails.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah it should be interesting and then I'm always curious you know today do they push a rails 510.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Release and then figure out some of these issues on Windows or do they have people complaining to them right now.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For some of these things in the go okay we'll fix them fix that will fix that and use that actually treat him as blockers until I get it out.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[45:00] So if you're on a Windows computer and if you don't want to,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">can I drink sea bass from Windows Kool-Aid Jessie I just had a few her for compatibility and check out the doctor you know dr. is a great alternative and actually just recorded this past weekend,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">no or I guess at the time of this recording dr. for Windows intro to where I have a,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly vanilla rails application using some external sources like my Sequel and redness and just building a doctor file that will be able to install and run your rails application Within,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux containers,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">on your Windows PC but then so have access to your application on the Windows side that edited and use your favorite Sublime Text at or whatever just natively on the computer and.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My point with that is with dr. and some the new features a real 510 you can log in to the doctor container which you can then run your yarn commands and stuff like that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you can install the dependencies are packages for the different JavaScript libraries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[46:13] Yeah I actually have VMware Workstation on here so it would actually got a Mac OS and Ubuntu server setup and so I'll probably wind up doing some of the work on those.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But I really do want to see what the experience is like running Ruby on Windows and just see what you know if anything they are still you know where the issues are.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah and before I got it back back in the day you know so few years ago I use virtualbox to virtualize like it too and then I just create a network share within their access all of the,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">code on my local Windows machine and they just kind of transfer it locally on that,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">internal Network so that's how I used to develop by reels application but never on a Windows,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike sollie Windows without some kind of Linux hypervisor or something like that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah I'm just curious to see what thing I'm sorry going back to your point about dr. you're probably just do an episode on dr. at some point but.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are actually images out there so you don't actually have to go out and set up a doctor in the edit your doctor file to get postgresql or MySQL running,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you can actually just installed doctor and then tell it to download and run the postgres or the MySQL or whatever else Oracle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Docker container and it'll pull it down and set it up for you so yeah it's really nice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[47:46] And there were way off in the weeds in to talk about this in the future but.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright well when we do some pics do you want.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter this is Charles Max one I just wanted to talk to you really briefly about freelancer.com.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm putting on a conference for people who want to go freelance or who are freelance and bringing in some of the experts from the freelancer show to talk to you about how to find clients how to collect money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How to build your business how to specialize and much much more so if you're thinking about going freelance or you're already freelance and want to hear from the experts on house to go.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Become.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grow your freelancing business then by all means come check us out a freelancer milk.com alright well when we do some pics do you want to start us off with pics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I am done with my pics on power tools,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so I think I'm all power sold out but one thing I have is a program that I found call Mineo and,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">it is basically a Amazon S3 compliant API that you can host yourself so,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I'll swing around with this on a application that I have just you know for my own personal stuff and a used S3 on my testing environment my development environment and the plumbing head was I didn't want to push these files up to S3 even in a test bucket cuz that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:18] Costs money came out of my ear free trial,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">from a wso now is charging me money this way I can have my own locally installed S3 complain API and buckets and I can just,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">does everything work leave without actually having to go out and hit the internet,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">so it's a pretty cool thing and it was a drop-in replacement almost for my rails application so it's pretty cool.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[49:46] Nice yeah speaking of that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a really interesting talk and I really want to dig into it some more but there was a talk at GSR mill, then this isn't a WS specific but they have a system called the Lambda.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Manager has as your functions there are a handful of other systems out there that do the same thing IBM has one that was what the talk was,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">actually about it yes or no, but he was talking about using these systems for kind of that one off,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">sort of jobs you kind of things that you you would do and some people that built their entire application so they have like you're really thin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Application that just outsources everything to a Lambda function that then integrates with whatever else you have dinner great with on the web and so I've been looking at a lot of those systems to run some of the things that I want to run.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that's cool this actually supports Linda functions a really yeah,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">to check it out I'll have to check it out that's really cool but yeah so that's something that I'm excited about what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to figure out because.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda only supports nodejs and python I think and so I'm trying to figure out how to make the connection.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To slack with cuz what I want is I want to system that I can essentially hit an endpoint and have it invite somebody to a slack group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[51:23] I'm trying to make that happen with no Jas and two hits It's been a little less than obvious but I haven't spend a ton of time digging into it yet either so.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway should be kind of interesting to see how that all works out but I do like the idea of not having to maintain a system that does it you know I just,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">you know have my website hits a pier and have a beer it doesn't point then it just works.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To pick that talk and then I'm also going to pick.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[51:58] I can't even talk anymore and then I'm also going to pick aws-lambda cuz it's cool stuff.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright well let's go ahead and wrap this up I will have some links to some of the resources we mentioned in the show notes about the Ruby rails 5 1.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And the questions I put them in the comments and hopefully we can get you some answers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">[52:25] Yeah thanks for having me again all right talk to everybody next week.</span>
