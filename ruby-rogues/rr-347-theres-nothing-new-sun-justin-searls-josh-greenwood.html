<b>Special Guest: Justin Searls and Josh Greenwood</b>

In this episode, the Ruby Rogues speaks with Justin Searls and Josh Greenwood. Justin and Josh both work for a software agency called <a href="http://testdouble.com">Test Double</a>, who are a fully remote software agency. Both Josh and Justin are well versed in many technologies and platforms of development such as Ruby, Javascript and much more.  Both Justin and Josh are on the show to talks about their recent presentation “There's Nothing New Under the Sun,” which was presented at conferences.

<b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b>
<ul>
 	<li>History and the knowledge of the community</li>
 	<li>Abandoning Gems</li>
 	<li>Exploratory</li>
 	<li>The rise of Rails</li>
 	<li>How much of what you do is in Ruby and Rails?</li>
 	<li>New contracts - How long do they last?</li>
 	<li>Secrets to onboard members or developers?</li>
 	<li>Overwhelmed with projects?</li>
 	<li>Where do you see Ruby in the next few years?</li>
 	<li>Slowing of processors - Intel</li>
 	<li>Working with other languages, then into Ruby</li>
 	<li>Jim!</li>
 	<li>Our industry’s obsession at placing novelty/newness above deeper truths and wisdoms. Once the shine has worn off we tend to ignore it, and even the timeline-style most information consumption software is designed with goes out of its way to bury anything “old”</li>
 	<li>What important context new Ruby developers tend to lack (this was the motivation for the talk in the first place) and what can we do to make them more comfortable &amp; capable</li>
 	<li>Straight up nostalgia time. Folks who’ve been in Ruby for a while should find motivation and encouragement by celebrating our past more often to remind ourselves of why we love Ruby</li>
 	<li>and much much more.</li>
