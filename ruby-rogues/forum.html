<div id="forum_description">

The Ruby Rogues Parley group is our private community email list/forum and is <strong>the</strong> place to be to get access to insightful discussion about the shows, code, and development. You can talk with the Rogues, hear show news first, discuss topics with other listeners, and even chat with many of our guests. We keep it private and ask for a small contribution both to keep the spammers out and to support the Ruby Rogues show. Contributions help Rogues cover travel and expenses to appear at conferences, buy books to review, and pay for custom made pirate hats. We appreciate all your support, and just ask that you remember MINASWAN!
