<b>Panel: </b>
<ul>
 	<li>Charles Max Wood</li>
 	<li>Dave Kimura</li>
 	<li>David Richards</li>
</ul>
In this episode of Ruby Rogues, the panel discusses where they are right now and what their day to day looks like. Dave is with <a href="https://www.sage.com/en-us/">Sage Software</a> and continues to push himself so that he will always be learning and progressing. He has three kids currently and he tries to have a good work-life balance so that he can separate both of his worlds. David is currently at a Fintech company where he is on the core team and does the data science. He also writes a lot and explores his creativity through that. Charles finds himself working a lot on the podcasts and has to schedule time to code. He works from home and therefore gets to spend a good amount of time with his family. The panel also talks about the importance of family, the need to challenge yourself, and much more!
