So what have you been doing since the last time we talked to you? What made you want to write React Native Express?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>5:06</strong>

Can you talk about who would be that best users would be for React Native Express? So what were some of the technical challenges you came across when you were building?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>6:52</strong>

so does React Native Web handle the styling for you, so it can compile for the web correctly? Is it possible to download and tryout, and can one contribute back? Is there anything else you would add to React Native Express or do you consider this guide finished?

Can we talk about the new Navigation Action, can you talk about what you know? So is the Repo. ready for us to check out? Any idea when they may be releasing this Repo?
