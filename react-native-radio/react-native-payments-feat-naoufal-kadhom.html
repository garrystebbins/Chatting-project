<strong><u>Discussions and Questions:</u></strong>

<strong><u> </u></strong>

<strong>1:00</strong>

Since you been on the show before, can give us and updated ground? So you are doing Native web? So is the RN a warper around the payment API? So is this a new web API?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>4:40</strong>

What was the reason for the payment API? Have you integrated with things like PayPal or Strip or things like that?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>7:00</strong>

What is Brain Tree? Do you have to use Apple Pay or just Brain Tree? What are you using for the view?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>13:00</strong>

Is this where all payments are headed? So Apple Pay will take over the world… Is there anything else a developer could add to this experience, shipping…?

&nbsp;

<strong>18:00</strong>

What go you interested in this stuff? Do you happen to know any website that support the payment setup already?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>25:00</strong>

How difficult was it to start to with iOS and bridging?

<strong> </strong>

<strong>29:30</strong>

So where do you Apple payments are going to go?

&nbsp;

<strong>33:00</strong>

Where else can people go to learn more on Payments? Once Chrome picks this up, do you think think this will be more abundant? So you think there will be a cross platform module for web and iOS?
