<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guests:</b></span><span class="s2"> Josh Saint Jacque </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In this episode, the panel talks with Josh St. Jacque who is married with two kids and with one on the way. He is a professional product manager and software engineer. <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"><span class="s3">Ruby on Rails</span></a> got him started on his career path and journey. Check-out today’s episode where the panel discusses functional and class components, among many other things!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:12 – Let’s have a conversation about functional components.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:20 – Chuck to Nader: “What is your preference between class and functional components?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:18 – Nader to Josh: “What is your take on pure components”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:20 – Who makes these architectural decisions at <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com"><span class="s3">T-Mobile</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:46 – Josh: It really depends on the team and the project depending on how they want to proceed. Josh mentions <a href="https://angular.io/guide/quickstart"><span class="s3">Angular</span></a> among other things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:38 – Chuck to Josh: It seems that through your post you are trying to make code easier?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:01 – Josh’s background is <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"><span class="s3">Ruby</span></a>, and basic principles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:12 – Question directed to Josh about components.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:05 – Functional components. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:35 – Some say that functional components are faster/slower than others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">12:50 – When do you know you need/do not need a functional component?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:15 Josh uses functional component as his default but, of course, there are different factors for him to consider. The presentational stuff is separated. Sometimes he does convert it over.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:21 – Let’s talk through the log post. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:15 – <a href="https://medium.com/@joshsaintjacque/small-functions-considered-awesome-c95b3fd1812f"><span class="s3">Digital Ocean’s</span></a> mid-roll advertisement!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:58 – The panel talks about pros and cons of the different components. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">21:33 – <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"><span class="s3">Ruby on Rails</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:06 – “Why aren’t you using...?” I understand what the tradeoffs are and will change when that time comes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:03 – Is there a certain thing that you would tell them about React applications? Is it more just best practice and it doesn’t really change their learning of the framework?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:28 – Whenever you get comfortable then start exploring another pattern. When you get really comfortable, then you might never see the tradeoffs by using other options. It’s good for a developer to always be open-minded. Keep yourself uncomfortable, and don’t have just one tool in your belt. Try functional components just to keep it fresh.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:00 – Josh answers a question from Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:00 – Josh talks about things to avoid, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:42 – Nader: “Have you seen the new features and possibly the new features that will be added on later?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:01 – Josh has started using new features and he talks about the pros and cons of these. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:55 – Chuck to Josh: “Are there any features to the components that you wish they would add?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:08 – Josh: I never really have run into anything, yet, that is too frustrating. I really like that it is a little limited, and no real big complaints. I would imagine that there are good components around function.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:42 – Nader to Josh: “Any other topics?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:54 – One thing Josh would like to say is that you and your team are on the same page. You don’t want to get into fights on what style you are using. You don’t want to constantly be changing the code. Use one thing at a time or it will get real messy too quick. One example of this is from Ruby: <a href="http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built_in_classes/hashes.html"><span class="s3">hash rockets.</span></a> </span></p>
