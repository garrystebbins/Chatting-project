<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">0:36 – Chuck: Our guest is Aaron, say HI! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">0:41 – Aaron: Hi! I have been working on the web for 20 plus years. I am working on the Edge team for accessibility among other things. I have done every job that you can do on the web.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:08 – Chuck: That is one of OUR publications?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:14 – Aaron: No the communities. I joined the staff as editor in chief for 1.5 year now. It’s a nice side project to do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:36 – Chuck: I thought it was a commercial thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:40 – Aaron: No it’s volunteer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">1:52 – Chuck: Talk about your web background?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">2:02 – Aaron: I remember the first book I got (title mentioned). My first job on the web (cash) I was the content manager in Florida and this was in 1999. Gel Macs just came out. I relocated from FL to CT and worked for other companies. I got into CSS among other things. It’s been a wild ride and done it all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">3:52 – Chuck: Let’s talk about web standards?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">4:05 – Aaron: It depends on the organization and what the spec is and where it originates. It’s interesting to see how HTML developed back in the day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">When standardization started working then everything started to converge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Everything is a little different now. Some specs come out from companies that...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><i>(Apple, </i><a href="https://responsiveimages.org"><span class="s3"><i>Responsive Images</i></span></a><i>, and Grid are mentioned among other things.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">7:37 – Chuck: We set up to talk about PWAs. Where did PWAs come from?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">7:57 – Aaron: Modern web design, best web applications. Being secure. One of the underpinnings came out from Google and they have been supporters of that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Firefox is working on installation as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">The Chrome implementation is weird right now, but it becomes an orphaned app. It’s like the old chrome apps where in Windows you can install from the Microsoft store. But the case of Chrome you don’t have to go through the store. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">10:14 – Chuck asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">10:24 – Aaron answers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">11:53 – Chuck: What makes it a progressive web app rather than a regular website?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">12:05 – Aaron: The definition is running on HTPS and...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><i>Aaron defines the terms that Chuck asks at 11:53. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">12:43 – Aaron: Of course you can push forward if it makes sense from the baseline.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">12:56 – Chuck: We have an Angular podcast, and we talked about PWAs and nobody had a good definition for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">13:18 – Aaron.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">13:22 – Chuck: What are the pros of having a PWA? Let’s start with the basics first.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">13:33 – Aaron: The ability to control how you react to the network. We development is challenging maybe in other areas because of the lack of control and how your code gets to your users. Any special needs that YOU might have. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><i>Aaron goes into detail on this topic.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">17:14 – Chuck: Is the service worker the star for PWAs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">17:20 – Aaron: In a way, kind of. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><i>Aaron goes into detail on this topic. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><i>Share 2 is mentioned, too. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">19:42 – Chuck: If the service worker intermediates between the browser and the page / Internet would it make sense to have your worker have it load and then load everything else? Cause you have those Web Pack now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">20:14 – Aaron: Some people would consider it but I wouldn’t necessarily. I am not a fan for that. If anything goes wrong then nothing loads. I remember back when...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">22:23 – Aaron: That is a lot of overhead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">22:34 – Chuck: I am wondering what is the best practice? How do you decide to pull in a service worker and then move into more complicated issues?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">22:53 – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDWpGhFB8j6Kia4B_MKUG3w"><span class="s3">Aaron</span></a>: Progressive Web App where they talk about their evolution about this. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">25:17 – <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=%255Bfreshbooks%255D&amp;kw=freshbooks&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;kwid=kwd-298507762065&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=289640536553&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzpSso-SY3gIVDoxpCh0-HwkaEAAYASAAEgI6JfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CNGHh6XkmN4CFQO5TwodEqEA2w"><span class="s3">Advertisement – Fresh Books!</span></a> Code: DEVCHAT.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">26:25 – Chuck: In order to be a PWA you don’t need to have a push notification.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">26:38 – Aaron: I don’t think anyone would want a push notification from me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">27:12 – Chuck: What features do PWAs have?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">27:18 – Aaron: Features? None of them really, other than push notifications, it’s just standard it’s going to make an App feel more App “y”. If that’s something you want to do. It’s up to you to determine that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">There is going to be like push notifications – sending person new updates about the order. If you were a new site you want to make sure you are not doing a push notifications on everything cause that would be too much. Exercising care with the capabilities with what the users are doing on your computer. This is a person that you are dealing with. We need to seem less needy. Give users control of how they want to use it. For example, Twitter will give you that control per user. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">30:56 – Chuck: Could you also do it for different parts of the page? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">31:01 – Aaron: It’s different scopes. Your servicer worker has different scopes and it needs to be in the root folder or the JavaScript folder. You can have different workers but they will come from different scopes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">31:32 – Chuck gives a hypothetical example.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">31:50 – You can do a bunch of different service workers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">32:11 – Chuck: This is why we create different hierarchies in our code.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">32:26 – Chuck: Is there a good point where people can be more informed with PWAs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">32:40 – Aaron: <a href="https://www.pwastats.com"><span class="s3">PWA stats website</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pwastats"><span class="s3">Twitter account</span></a> with Cloud 4. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">33:22 – Chuck asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">33:26 – Aaron: Yes. If you are a photographer you don’t want to cash all of your photos on someone’s hard drive. We have to be good stewards of what is operating on people’s hard drives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Even something as simple as a blog can benefit from being a PWA.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">35:01 – Chuck: Are there new things that are being added to a PWA?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">35:12 – Aaron: A new feature is the background sync. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Aaron: What is native and what is web?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">36:33 – Chuck: Yeah it can detect a feature in your machine. Dark mode is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">36:48 – Aaron: It would be nice to see things standardized across the board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">37:00 – Chuck: How does this play into <a href="https://electronjs.org"><span class="s3">Electron</span></a> or Android or...? Do those need to be PWAs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">37:16 – Aaron: It depends on what you are building. So I talked with people through Slack and they want total control. If you r desire is to shift the same experience then <a href="https://electronjs.org"><span class="s3">Electron</span></a> can make a lot of sense. They will have to pay a premium, though, your users. If you are aware of that then go the <a href="https://electronjs.org"><span class="s3">Electron</span></a> route. But for most cases then <a href="https://electronjs.org"><span class="s3">Electron</span></a> might be overkill for you. You don’t need that extra overhead. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">39:55 – <i>Aaron continues.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">Aaron: I think the major benefit of PWA is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">41:15 – Chuck: The other angle to that is that in an Electron app does it make sense to use a PWA things?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">41:23 – Aaron: Yes that makes sense. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">41:34 – Unless for some reason you need to unlock into an older version, which I hope is not the case b/c of security reasons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">41:55 – <i>Aaron continues.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">42:34 – Chuck: Where can we find you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4">42:35 – Aaron mentions Twitter and other sites. See Links! </span></p>
