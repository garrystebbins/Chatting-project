<p class="p6"><span class="s3">0:55 – Chuck: This week I am talking with <a href="https://github.com/rubyhero"><span class="s7">Paweł Dąbrowski</span></a></span><span class="s8"> who was on</span><span class="s3"> <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-366-build-your-own-rspec-a-gentle-metaprogramming-intro-with-pawel-d%25C4%2585browski/"><span class="s6">episode 366.</span></a> Give us a brief description of who you are, please. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:25 – Guest: I run a company and I am here b/c of the article I wrote. It was a nice introduction to...programming. I write in my <a href="https://pdabrowski.com/blog/articles"><span class="s6">blog</span></a> and have written a few gems. I created a course how to build Ruby Flow. Also, I create Ruby code every day. I think that’s it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:19 – Chuck: I am curious, how did you get into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:30 – Guest: It all started in school when he asked me to create a website using HTML code. I fell in-love with it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">I didn’t want to give up and figured it all boils down to: “how bad do you want it?”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">4:33 – Chuck: Yeah it was PHP for me, too. I could do dynamic things with this. I was a computer science major, and to build something REAL was amazing. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">5:04 – Guest: Yes, when something works it’s amazing. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">5:25 – Chuck: Yeah, when you realize you left out a semi-colon – oh no! In some ways, PHP was a friendly-way to do web development. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:05 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:22 – Chuck: How old were you when you got paid for web development?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:32 – Guest: I think I was sixteen years old and $50.00 was a fortune for me. I felt like a millionaire. It felt great to make money for something you love to do. It wasn’t work; I just enjoyed doing it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:07 – Chuck: That’s the magic!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:14 – Guest: If you are doing something you love, then it’s great!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:24 – Chuck: How did you go from PHP to one-page apps to Ruby?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:35 – Guest: I didn’t like PHP at some point. I fell in-love with Ruby’s syntax. I was afraid that I wasn’t going to find a job. I wrote a programmer and told him that I have “no experience and no technical training...” I didn’t think it was possible, and he said that it was possible based on the work that I put in. I remember writing code in Ruby. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:42 – Chuck: What drew you to Ruby?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:48 – Guest: The community and the syntax. I love writing in Ruby, and I don’t know if I will switch my languages in the future. I want to create a more active Ruby community in Poland. I want to get junior developers involved.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">10:29 – Chuck: Tell us about your blog!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">10:40 – Guest: I started writing every day. I started in January and kept going for three months. I thought that was crazy, and so I wrote less frequently. I thought it was a game-changing decision for me b/c it took me to a new level. I wrote more, learned more, and it has given me visibility.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">11:47 – Chuck: I have talked to people in various parts of the world. People say that it could be a barrier of only English-written blogs.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">12:15 – Guest: I learned English once I got serious about coding/programming. I think it’s a disadvantage if you don’t know English.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">12:35 – Chuck: What are you working on now?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">12:40 – Guest: I am starting this project and decided to turn-it-up b/c at first it was experimental. I wanted to move people more in the Polish community. I write about <a href="https://pdabrowski.com/blog/books/soft-skills-the-software-developers-life-manual"><span class="s6">soft skills</span></a> and that developers should have those skills, too. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">13:22 – Chuck: This episode won’t come out for a few months. If you want to plug that – you can if you are comfortable with it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">13:44 – Guest: I want to set-up interviews, and create a dictionary so people can check single words and their meaning and see what it looks like in another language. Also, working on the content of blogs, and maybe recording a video on HOW to code. I was involved in a webinar and starting my first conference. Give the</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">14:56 – Chuck: Where can people find you? How about your blog?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:05 – Guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/pdabrowski_k1"><span class="s6">Twitter!</span></a> <a href="https://github.com/rubyhero"><span class="s6">GitHub!</span></a> Blog! LinkedIn!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:27 – Chuck: Any recommendations for people who are getting into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:42 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Guest: DOING and creating the stuff, and ultimately getting the experience. You can eventually find your dream job!</span></p>
