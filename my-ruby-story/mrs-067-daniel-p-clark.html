<p class="p4"><span class="s3">0:58 – Guest: Hi!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:01 – Chuck: Introduce yourself real quick, please, and what are you known for? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:08 – Guest: My blog posts – I write about about Ruby. I have a few projects that are well known: Faster Path among others. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:35 – Chuck: We had you on a past episode, <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-368-improving-ruby-performance-with-rust-with-daniel-p-clark/"><span class="s2">368 Ruby Rogues</span></a>. Where do you write?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:49 – Guest: I am a contractor and I write blog posts for them. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1:58 – Chuck: Let’s talk about you! How did you get into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">2:07 – Guest: My dad is a programmer and before 5</span><span class="s5"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s3"> grade I got a computer and no Internet. I tried things to see how things worked. I wrote from the top down – recipe style. I really enjoyed programming back then. Later in life, Java was the next big thing and for me to get into it was harder. I got a book and figured out how to compile it. I stopped programming when I wrote HELLO WORLD! I came across Python at some time. At the same style I wrote my Q basic programs, things were more functional. That’s my entry into programming.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:05 – Chuck: What got you into Python?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:13 – Guest: The syntax in Java hurt in writing. With Python when I first started out it felt like it wasn’t asking me more than what I needed to do. It was very simple for me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:38 – Chuck: What did you build with Python?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4:43 – Guest: Connect 4 in Python and command line tools. Simple things. I wrote one time a sales website in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"><span class="s2">Django</span></a> with Python and use with Google Pay. I wrote it and it got to launch point and then I was done.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:30 – Chuck: How Did you get into Ruby?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">5:35 – Guest: A childhood friend who loved Pearl and at the time I loved Python. We would friendly argue about which one was better. He talked to companies for me, and he edified my abilities in their eyes. I’ve been with Ruby since and I have a passion with it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">7:02 – Chuck: Why Ruby?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">7:06 – Guest: With Python I never learned object oriented design and I never got into a community with Python. I didn’t connect with a broader community. I was constantly learning new things with Ruby. I connected a lot with people and shared with them the things that I’ve learned.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">8:11 – Chuck: What have you done in Ruby? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">8:15 – Guest: Almost you name it – I haven’t done graphics with gaming. I have done tons with the web side of things. I’ve done command line game and flashcards for learning language characters. That specific project was one of my favorite projects. I designed an entire...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">9:14 – Chuck: Model view graphics for command line - how does that work?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">9:23 – Guest: Rails has model view controller I followed that same schema. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:00 – Chuck: Is it open source somewhere?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:05 – Guest: Yes. Language Cards through GitHub. There are 2 languages that you can start learning with.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:28 – Chuck: Performance on Ruby – how did you get into that angle?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">10:51 – Guest: I agreed to work with shares in a startup company and I worked a year on it. It was heavy on features. One thing I noticed was that the load time for the front page was unacceptable (loading time). I wanted to figure out where the bottlenecks were. I wrote my first bit of code and linked it up with Ruby and I got my website to run 30% faster. Seeing that – that was exciting. It seemed like I accomplished something and I wanted to share it with the community. It drew a lot of attention. I thought it was a cool novel idea and I became well known for it. I put more time into it b/c I wanted it to look better since it got so much attention. I’ve learned a lot and I’ve dove into the C code b/c I am improving the libraries. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">13:39 – Chuck: Getting those C libraries up?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">13:45 – Guest: That is the most recent thing I am working with. My project RU RU hasn’t been worked on in a while, so I created an official fork for it – you can call it: <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/p/6h09os-announcing-rutie-the-tie-between-ruby-and-rust"><span class="s2">RUTIE.</span></a> So much work has been put into it. I am very excited about this project. It’s very active right now.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">14:56 – Chuck: How do people find you online?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">15:05 – Guest: <a href="https://github.com/danielpclark"><span class="s2">GitHub</span></a>, <a href="https://6ftdan.com"><span class="s2">my website</span></a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/6ftdan?lang=en"><span class="s2">Twitter!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">15:27 – Chuck: What if people want to contract you?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">15:34 – Guest: Check out my résumé, which will show my areas of expertise. They can find ways to reach me, and my contact information is mentioned there. I like working on full-stack Ruby and/or Rust and anything performance.</span></p>
