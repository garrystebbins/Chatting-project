<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">0:53 – Introduction. <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-326-chatbots-jamie-wright/"><span class="s2">Episode 326 of Ruby Rogues</span></a> is a past episode with <a href="https://twitter.com/jwright?lang=en"><span class="s2">Jamie</span></a> as a guest. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1:50 – Chuck was at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build"><span class="s2">Microsoft Build</span></a>. It’s interesting to see where all of this stuff comes out. Interesting to see where it will be in the next few years. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">2:31 – There is a lot of room for improvement – Google Dispatch. It is their AI, which is insane. Compare that to last year, it’s leap and bounds different.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">2:59 – Let’s talk about your story, Jamie. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">3:10 – Jamie started programming in high school, which was offered through an introduction course. It was in Basic. His cousin who was a programmer, too, influenced him. Jamie took this course, and he made a tic-tac-toe game. Went he went to college he took computer science, and fell in love with it there. Jamie loves the idea of creating things from nothing to something. It is art to me. It’s pretty neat. It’s not like you are investing hundreds of thousands into a fashion line, it’s just your time into a computer. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">4:48 – Chuck makes some comments. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">4:57 – Jamie mentors children from 7 – 17 years old. Works with a program, which is worldwide. Jamie helps the kids build their own games.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">5:29 – Chuck: That sounds like fun!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">5:35 – Seeing a side of programming where there aren’t any deadlines. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">5:45 – Chuck reflects on Jamie’s previous comment. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:03 – Jamie: It’s fun to put all of that stuff aside and watch people tinker. And hearing all of the “Oh’s and Ah’s!” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:22 – Chuck: How did you get into <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:31 – Jamie: Code Mash (local). Leon, in 2006/2007, was doing a workshop for <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>, and Jamie fell in love with it. He tinkered around with it in Rails, and he was hooked ever since. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">7:25 – What got you excited about it?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">7:36 – A.) You had to be on Windows B.) You needed Microsoft Tooling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Just the ease of opening up a terminal, and that there was less friction – it was just easy!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Jamie continues to talk about the other reasons why he fell in love with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>. He also enjoys the community. For him it was a good decision and it is fun for me. The fun factor is still there for me. Jamie loves <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:22 – Chuck: What have you done in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>? We talked about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot"><span class="s2">Chatbots</span></a> earlier. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:30 – Jamie’s first project was a To Do List app. He wanted to do a task list from just one sentence. Jamie created MORALE, and it did okay for a while. That was his first app in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>’s. As far as open source work, Jamie hasn’t done anything that hasn’t really taken off. He created LAZINESS. Listen to this timestamp for other of Jamie’s projects and creations that he has been apart of. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">11:12 – Chuck to Jamie: What are you most proud of?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">11:14 – Jamie: I am most proud of teaching. I have created workshops. I see the same excitement that I had about <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>’s. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">11:49 – Chuck: It’s interesting to see what people really care about. Something I did helped someone else and their future, which is really cool.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">12:29 – I am playing with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org"><span class="s2">Elixir</span></a> now, because of <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a>, among other projects. Other projects: Pomodoro’s App and integration.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">14:49 – Jamie: “<a href="https://elixir-lang.org"><span class="s2">Elixir</span></a> is awesome. I feel like it is a perfect language for Chatbots.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">15:31 – Chuck: We will have to dive into that a little more. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">16:06 – Chuck: Do you have some picks for us? </span></p>
