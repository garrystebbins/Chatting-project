<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This week on My Ruby Story, <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s2">Charles</span></a> talks to <a href="https://github.com/erikdietrich"><span class="s2">Erik Dietrich</span></a> who is a consultant and a business owner. After he left the IT life, he is a partner for a content marketing company among others. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">0:52 – Greetings! It’s another story on Ruby Stories.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1:04 – We have had you on Episode 296. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1:28 – <a href="https://github.com/erikdietrich"><span class="s2">Guest:</span></a> I did in my blogger days, but over the course of time but I ran into management roles and then left. That definitely skewed my topics that I talked about.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1:59 – Chuck: Introduce yourself for people. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">2:53 – Chuck: Let’s talk about your career or even further back. How did you get into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">3:24 – Guest: My father introduced me into my project. Into my educational background I do remember banging away at my computer because there weren’t any courses offered (at the time).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">4:13 – Chuck: Let’s talk about computer science.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">4:22 – guest: I had to apply to the computer science program to the college I went to. I knew I wanted to do something cutting-edge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">4:42 – Chuck: After college where did you end up?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">4:55 – Guest: I graduated in 2001 from college. I did some odd jobs. Thankfully, the economy was stronger for me to be a software engineer title. Then from there...</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">5:57 – Chuck: When I graduated I started off with Tech Support then Q/A. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:12 – Chuck: It sounds like you worked all over the place? Is it deliberate when you chance course within your career? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:36 – Guest: Actually, it was full circle for me. At some point, I did get more career-minded. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">8:01 – Chuck: How did you end up there – the programming job?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">8:13 – Guest: My mom left, but worked at X company. The co. knew that she had a son that finished a computer science degree. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:10 – Chuck: The recruiters should be use to that at some point.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:23 – <a href="https://github.com/erikdietrich"><span class="s2">Guest</span></a> added some more thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:50 – Chuck: Talk about the progression you’ve made. I know Ruby is not your primary focus of your background. Take people on a tour. I’m curious if we can talk about how you got into the consulting and marketing roles that you fill these days.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">10:28 – Guest: Whistle stop of my career, here we go. The first 10 years, it was pretty standard. Across a few different companies went from one position to another up to the architectural role. Then, I went through job-hopping. I ended up doing independent consulting and freelance works. I didn’t know really, though, what I wanted to do. Coaching people is what I did for a while. There I discovered something – I enjoyed that coaching work. More opportunities that I had, and then I realized it was a good fit. Over the course of time, I had the blog, which was reflecting anything I was doing. If I am writing about x, y, z, I was blogging about it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">14:28 – Chuck: How do you know which opportunity to pursue?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">14:38 – Guest: General, I was say...</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">15:52 – Chuck: What are you most proud of?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">16:04 – Guest: The blog. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">17:28 – Guest: My book. Check it out. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Erik-Dietrich/e/B00J6314XY"><span class="s2">Amazon</span></a> and <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/daedtech"><span class="s2">Leanpub</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">17:47 – Chuck: What are you working on now?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">17:58 – Guest answers this question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">21:12 – Chuck: Any other thing you’d like to talk about?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">21:27 – Guest chimes in with his ideas. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">24:25 – Guest: Whatever adds to your happiness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">24:36 – Chuck: I get to choose what I want to work on. I find that the freer that I am to make my own decisions the happier I am.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">25:09 – Guest: I had a hard time being told to do things from senior roles in the job. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">25:42 – Chuck: I think more companies will be willing to bring some people in for a specific project/job.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">26:39 – Guest: I get into trend projection into my book. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">28:04 – Chuck: One more question that I have. As people are coming into this pool – what do you advise those people to see where the industry is going? Where to get a job? Long-term?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">28:35 – Guest: To get a job in the entry level is kind of hustling. If you are struggling then write about a blog. Get there a social profile that makes you different from all the others. Does the company have the faintest idea of who you are and what you can do? Position yourself as an expert. If you can show that you are standing out from your peers then your career will advance much more quickly. Not necessarily being “better then them.” How are you different?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">30:23 – Chuck: Yep, these things I push people toward in my new course. Meet the right people; build those relationships. They probably get dozens or dozens of applications. They can find someone to write code but it’s the underlining stuff that they are looking for. </span></p>
