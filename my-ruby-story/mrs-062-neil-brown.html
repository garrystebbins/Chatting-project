<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>Guest:</b> Dr. <a href="https://twitter.com/jwright?lang=en"><span class="s2">Neil Brown</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This week on My Ruby Story, <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s2">Charles</span></a> talks with Dr. Neil Brown who is a researcher. He helps people teach “how to program” more effectively and efficiently. Check out his social media pages and his research via the web. Chuck and Neil talk about his research among other topics. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">0:52 – Chuck: We are talking with Neil Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1:05 – Chuck: I’ve always wanted to go to London! Let’s dive in and talk about you and how you got into all of this stuff.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">1:40 – Neil: I was in primary/elementary school and sometime there I went to my dad and I asked him how are these games made? He gave me a book.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">3:12 – Chuck: What are some things that you are researching?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">3:24 – Neil answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">5:24 – Chuck: How do you know what to look into and how do you test your hypotheses? There is some science there.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">5:45 – Neil: We have a large data collection. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:07 – Chuck: You have your own ideas linked to Java?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:15 – Neil: Yep.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:20 – Chuck: Do people know that they are test subjects?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:31 – Neil: Oh yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:39 – Chuck comments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:45 – Chuck: What do programmers see?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">6:55 – Neil: It is interesting to see the code that they are writing. You are not sure what they are trying to do. Programming is a very frustrating experience for most people. I want to reach back in time and tell them that the problem is there. You watch people do it and they kind of in the right area, and then they go somewhere else. It’s frustrating for beginners. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">8:06 – Chuck: How long have you been doing the research?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">8:05 – Neil: Five Years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">8:22 – Chuck: How would I get into something like that?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">8:32 – Neil answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:35 – Chuck: What are you most proud of?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">9:42 – Neil answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">11:34 – How do you communicate that to people in the “real world” in a professional setting?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">11:45 – Neil answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Neil: Be careful of your own expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">12:32 – Chuck: What are you doing now?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">12:35 – Neil answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">12:58 – Neil: Research is focused on the “new.” Making something “new.” We are doing essential work, but work that doesn’t get a lot of recognition. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">13:37 – Chuck: That’s interesting. What else should we dive into? I would love to have you back. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">13:57 – Chuck: Any advice for someone who wants to get into this area?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">14:00 – Neil: Study and get a Ph.D. to help you with research. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">14:40 – Chuck: There are a lot of universities who do this type of research?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">14:52 – Neil answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">15:35 – Picks! </span></p>
