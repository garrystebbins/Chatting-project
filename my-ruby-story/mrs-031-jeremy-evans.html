<b>Panel: </b>Charles Max Wood

<b>Guest:</b> Jeremy Evans

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Jeremy Evans. Jeremy has been programming Ruby since 2004, and is best known for working on <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda">Roda</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a>. He talks about his journey into programming, starting when he was in college and took an introduction to programming class that focused on C++, which he found interesting and then took the next courses in the series. This was just the beginning for his programming journey, though. Jeremy continues to talk about his present and future endeavors and how he is adding value to the Ruby community.
