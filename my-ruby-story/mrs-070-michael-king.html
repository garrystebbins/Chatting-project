<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><b>Guest:</b> </span><span class="s3">Michael King</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This week on My Ruby Story, Chuck talks with Michael King who is a developer, an enthusiast for natural languages, developing, and mathematics. Charles and Michael talk about his background, and past/current projects that Michael is working on right now. Other topics of discussion include Ruby, Rails, Audacity, PHP, RubyMotion, and React Native. Check it out!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">0:00 – <a href="http://getacoderjob.com/"><span class="s5">Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">0:58 – Chuck: Say “hi” Michael! Introduce yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">1:12 – Michael: I am a big language learner: Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese. I learned through T.V. and music. I decided to build an app that helped with languages. I started doing it. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">1:50 – Chuck: You hired a developer and had no idea what the developer what was doing. How do you make that transition? They just go with it – right? How did you decide: no, I have to understand THIS. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">2:25 – Guest: It’s either I am really into it or I am NOT into it. I have been always very good with mathematics. The computer broke when I was in school and the only option we had were these...He was writing all these variables and I loved variables. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><i>The guest talks about Ruby, Rails, and Audacity!</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">4:08 – Chuck: You talk about natural languages – I see the correlation sometimes and sometimes I don’t. I learned French in school, and then I became fluent in Italian during my Mormon missionary trips. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">4:56 – Guest: I am reading this book right now and you have to understand the technicians’ role in order to help lead him. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><i>The guest talks about the differences between coding, natural languages, and mathematics.</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">5:50 – Chuck: Did you let your developer go? Or did you keep him around?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:03 – Guest: I let him go actually b/c he was on for a part-time basis. I started coding myself. I got help from friends and I got help from a lot of other people. I would ask them tons of questions and form a friendly relationship with them. From there, it snowed-ball from there! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">6:57 – Guest: From that experience, I learned a lot. If I had to REDO what I did originally, then I would have done the following things differently...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">7:44 – Chuck: I can identify with that – I was a freelancer for 8-9 years. I would build something and then they say: that’s not what we hired you to build. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">8:10 – Guest: They wonder why they are getting this feedback?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">8:22- Chuck: Why Ruby on Rails?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">8:27 – Guest: I didn’t know the difference between mobile frameworks and web frameworks. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:01 – Chuck: Yeah I don’t like the word “dumb” either.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:09 – Guest: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><span class="s2">Ruby</span></a> was very smooth and I liked it. I got addicted to the process through the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails"><span class="s2">Rails</span></a> way and the Ruby syntax. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">9:46 – Chuck: Same for me. I have done <a href="http://www.php.net"><span class="s2">PHP</span></a> before but when I got into <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails"><span class="s2">Rails</span></a> it naturally flowed into the way I wanted to work on stuff. I get it.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:12 – Chuck: What are you working on now?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">10:19 – Guest: This project that I have been working on now for 1.5 years. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">11:41 – Chuck: You talked about how you picked up <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"><span class="s2">React Native.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">11:52 – Guest: Yes, yes. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:39 – Chuck: How did you settle on <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"><span class="s2">React Native?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">12:50 – <i>Guest talks about the Spanish and English languages. </i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">13:25 – Chuck: I am curious – why didn’t you go with <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com"><span class="s2">RubyMotion?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">13:34 – Guest: I didn’t know anyone that could help me honestly. Also, I didn’t think it was going to be EASY to learn for me. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:02 – Chuck: Is <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"><span class="s2">Reactive Native</span></a> your main focus?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:08 – Guest: No building just designing and putting it in front of people. I want to get a prototype to get more funding. I want to know EXACTLY what we are building. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:40 – Chuck: For entrepreneurs, any advice for anything to get this rolling?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">14:56 – Guest: If I had to do it again I would draw it out on paper and figure out how to get to MVP right away. I would try to get validation right away from not building too much</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">15:47 – Chuck: I am working on a service to help podcasters. They see that that I run 15 shows through DevChat.TV. If I can solve those three problems then I am golden: monetization and/or production. For scheduling guests it’s a pain point for most podcasters. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">17:36 – Chuck: Some of the validation for me is talking to people through conferences and other venues. Main question is: What are you doing for scheduling? It takes a bunch of time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Post to where people will get your content.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Have your guests promote it, too! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:05 – Guest: Inviting people to the show.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">20:13 – Chuck: This is the 16</span><span class="s6"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s3"> interview this week so far! To give you an idea! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">21:16 – Guest: You lost me along the way only b/c I don’t do podcasting. You know the problem b/c you are doing it, and you are within the field.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">21:42 – Chuck: The more I talk to people the more I get ideas and such.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">22:00 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">22:06 – Chuck: They are worried that their ideas are going to get stolen.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">22:15 – Chuck: It’s interesting to see where it goes. I have 2 more interviews after this. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Michael, you see and say: what solutions can I provide? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">23:03 – Chuck: Did we get into your mobile app then?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">23:14 – Guest: It was really hard for me, but now I love coding. Getting it in front of people and testing it. I am trying to keep my education going. I learn by doing and learning by being thrown in to the fire. I am doing a free code camp now. Any suggestions, Chuck that you could offer?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">24:35 – Chuck: Learning how to prioritize. What are you aiming at, and what goal are you trying to achieve? I want to make a video course on HOW to stay current? </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:12 – Chuck: Where can people find you?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:18 – Guest: Twitter! There really isn’t an easy way to find me online – something I should probably fix. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">25:28 – <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=freshbooks+%252Bx&amp;kw=freshbooks&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;kwid=kwd-298507762065&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8viYt8GL3gIVj4dpCh1UVgrBEAAYASAAEgK1afD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CL34x7jBi94CFVO6TwodjvwGtA"><span class="s5">Advertisement – Fresh Books!</span></a> </span></p>
