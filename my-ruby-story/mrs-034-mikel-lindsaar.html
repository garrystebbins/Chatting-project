<b>Panel: </b>Charles Max Wood

<b>Guest:</b> Mikel Lindsaar

This week on My Ruby Story, Charles talks to Mikel Lindsaar. Mikel started a Ruby on Rails consultancy in 2010 and is most well known for being the original author of Mail gem. He first got into programming working as a volunteer for a church where he built a Rails parishioner management system. This experience led him to create the Mail gem, which has really made him well-known in the community. He always likes the idea of being able to control and create something, and this has definitely influenced his programming career.
