This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with Houssein Djirdeh. Houssein works at <a href="https://rangle.io/">Rangle</a> currently and first got into programming during an intro to programming course in college and he initially hated it. A few years later he found out that he really was interested in programming when he wanted to build a website. From there he discovered JavaScript and Angular and has never looked back. He is most proud of his work on multiple Open Source projects and his blog posts.
