<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>Guest:</b></span><span class="s4"> <a href="https://github.com/LayZeeDK"><span class="s5">Lars Gyrup Brink Nielsen</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with <a href="https://github.com/LayZeeDK"><span class="s5">Lars Nielsen</span></a> who is a frontend developer, blogger, a tech speaker, and an OSS contributor. He has worked with many different frameworks, but he and Chuck talk in detail about Angular. Finally, they discuss Lars’ programming background and the current projects he is working on. Check out today’s episode to hear more! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">0:53 – Guest: Hello from Denmark!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">1:00 – Chuck: My great, great, great grandmother is Danish. Introduce yourself, please.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">1:20 – Guest: I have been working through various companies through my career. I have focused on frontend development and right now it’s Angular and before it was Angular.js and others. I have been developing C# and started off with PHP. So I really enjoy frontend development the most. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">1:58 – Chuck: I am talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/EisenbergEffect?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor"><span class="s5">Rob Eisenberg</span></a> in a few days. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">2:04 – Guest: From what I’ve heard he’s a great guy. He worked on the Angular router. He branched out to Greater Zone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">2:28 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">2:38 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">2:45 – Chuck: His episode will come out in 2 weeks! Tell us about you – what got you into programming?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">3:00 – Guest: It started when I was 5 years old. My brother and I broke 3-4 computers before they bought us a Nintendo set. That was my first dive into it. Then I went to PCs and back in 1999 I wrote my first website with Notepad. Then later I decided to make a career out of it and studied in college. Then started developing full-stack. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">4:53 – Chuck: You mentioned Knockout, Angular.js, and others. What have systems have you built in the backend?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">5:03 – Guest: Yes, PHP in the beginning. Then I moved onto... </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><i>(Guest continues answer Chuck’s question.)</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">6:30 – Chuck: What was about Angular that you liked? Why did you choose that framework? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">6:47 – Guest: I got to choose the frontend framework (at the job I was at), and I chose NOT to use Angular. At the time, I thought it was confusing and overwhelming. Ember was stronger for me back then. But then later I got the opportunity to work with it in my current job, and now I am enjoying it. It’s always a challenge.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">8:48 – Chuck: Seeing that transition and like that. I am curious though – what features do Angular have that Knockout and others don’t have for you? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">9:08 – Guest: We used Coffee Script back then. Do you know it?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">9:36 – Chuck: Yep I know it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">9:45 – Guest: I remember studying typescript, too. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Coffee Script removed a lot of the stupid errors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">11:22 – Chuck: I think typescript is the way to go.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">11:57 – Guest: It helps with those stupid errors that people make once in a while. It’s a type language. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">12:45 – (<i>Guest continues.</i>)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">13:14 – Chuck: Making the transition from Angular to Angular.js – what process did you go through?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">13:25 – (<i>Guest answers. He talks about starting from scratch to learn the new Angular.</i>)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">14:08 – Guest: I wouldn’t want to go back to Angular.js. There is so much to learn about Angular and working in-depth with it, there are still new things to explore every day, it’s a large framework. I guess that’s part of the reason why people use React and other frameworks b/c it can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I enjoy it now b/c I read it now as a native tongue / native language. That’s what I see now, but that’s not what you see at first b/c there are so many new syntaxes. React is mostly JavaScript. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">17:22 – Chuck: What features do you like about Angular <i>over</i> Angular.js?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">17:28 – Guest: It’s the performance – it’s important!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">18:20 – Chuck: What have you done in Angular that you are proud of?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">18:24 – Guest: I am working on a few articles and I am about to release 2 of them. It’s a whole series. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">I am going to <a href="https://gotocph.com"><span class="s5">Copenhagen</span></a> soon and I will be giving a talk. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">20:17 – Cuck: What else are you working on?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">20:23 – Guest: Yes, the articles. I am finishing those up. There will be 4-5 more in the series on that one topic. I want to focus on one topic at a time. There are 3 main concepts: container components, presentation components, and migration. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Yes improving my talk for next month’s conference. I am building a small app, too. Working with new technologies and learning about offline apps and install the apps natively on most platforms now. We aren’t dependent on official App Store now, that’s a thing of the past now. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">22:06 – Chuck: Where can people find you online?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">22:16 – Guest: I have a few projects through GitHub. Find me there. (See links below.) Read my articles when they are published on Medium. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">22:44 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">22:48 – Guest: My first published articles will be at <a href="https://blog.angularindepth.com/@LayZeeDK"><span class="s5">Angular In Depth.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">23:00 – Chuck: Picks!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">23:04 – <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-na-fb&amp;camp=US%2528SEM%2529Branded%257CEXM&amp;ag=%255Bfreshbooks%255D&amp;kw=freshbooks&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;kwid=kwd-298507762065&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;crid=285105591548&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhIm0z8uu3gIVk7fACh1niQUNEAAYASAAEgKeq_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"><span class="s5">Fresh Books!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">27:13 – Chuck: What is the tech scene like in Denmark?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">27:18 – Guest: You have to keep up the pace yourself b/c I live in a very small area. There are only a few cities in Denmark where the jobs are. I will go to Meetups and conferences and I am active on European Slack. That’s how I get to be social in the Angular community. I am mostly working at home. I have twin daughters who are 7 years old. I am mostly at the office, too, building and working there, which is 5 miles away from my home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">29:17 – Chuck: In the past episode I talked with someone from Bulgaria, it sounds similar to what you are saying Lars. I am curious are people willing to hire remote if they are outside of the city?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">29:40 – Guest: It depends on the company. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">30:25 – Chuck: Working remotely is definitely a skill. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">30:44 – Guest: I have worked remotely for some jobs b/c I was driving several hours a day. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">31:21 – Chuck: My longest commute was 30 minutes top, but I live in a heavy tech scene where I live. Do most people in Denmark know English?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">31:5- Guest: My daughters have been speaking English since 3-4 years old b/c of iPads. They are also taught English and German in the school, too. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">32:21 – Chuck: Anything else? Are there things that people don’t think about being a developer in Denmark?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">32:40 – Guest: There aren’t that many big companies. It’s difficult to get into the right place. There are small companies in Denmark. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">33:51 – Chuck: Does that change the way people find jobs in Denmark?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">33:59 – Guest: If you don’t like to work for a bank then you have a problem b/c that’s half the jobs! If you don’t like certain industries that could make it harder to get a job as a programmer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">34:33 – Chuck: I am going to wrap this up – anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">34:44 – Guest: Create a blog post or start an open source project. That’s what I do when I get bored. When you teach a subject you have to be an expert to be able to explain it to someone else. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">35:37 – (<i>Guest lists the titles of his articles – check it out at this timestamp!)</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">35:50 – <i>(Chuck discusses future episodes and future guests that he will interview.)</i></span></p>
