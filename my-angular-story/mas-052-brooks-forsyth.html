<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with</span><span class="s4"> <a href="https://twitter.com/brooks_forsyth"><span class="s5">Brooks Forsyth</span></a></span><span class="s1"> who is frontend developer who has been doing this for four years. He works for a large consulting corporation who will remain nameless, and he lives in Harper, Connecticut. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s6"><b>In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4:09 – Chuck: I would like to dive in. How did you get into Angular in the first place?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4:20 Guest: I was at a service desk in CT. One of my jobs was to open 75 different emails and make sure that it didn’t send an “error” message. I had to make sure nothing failed. That was boring. I used Auto Hot Key. That was fun, and did a lot of that there, which got me into programming. I had a Bachelor’s in Business. Went to get my Master’s in Computer Science, but took along time. Started doing IT recruiting. Then next thing you know I moved into my parents’ house and did coder camps. And that worked out. Then I got hired by the Charter Internet Company. Now I am in large consulting firm in CT. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">7:38 – Guest: I have 2 kids who are 4 years old and 1 years old. I have a really cool fish tank that has coral reef in it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8:00 – Chuck: Which Angular project was your favorite?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8:09 – Guest: Ionic Project was a lot of fun. The app was already written and I was to convert it. In theory not change the backend. I had a lot of fun making that app. I love working with Ionic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">9:37 – Chuck: Ionic is going into other frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">10:05 – Chuck: I have feelings about the show, The View. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">13:06 – Guest: I could be doing CSS but I rather be doing this instead. I don’t mind answering any questions or prodding the person to get more information. “What are the steps to recreate it?” And my answer was...</span></p>
