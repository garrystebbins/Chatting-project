<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Panel: </b>Charles Max Wood</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Guest: </b><a href="https://twitter.com/rustbeltrae?lang=en"><span class="s3">Rae Krantz </span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week on My Angular Story, Charles speaks with</span><span class="s4"> Rae Krantz</span><span class="s1"> (Akron, OH) who works remotely with the Toll Wave company (Phoenix, AZ). She does <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s3">Angular</span></a> work there with a small team. She specializes in information technology and services. Rachel (Rae) and Chuck talk about Angular and how she got her amazing job through a Twitter connection! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">In particular, we dive pretty deep on: </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">1:30 – Hello! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">1:35 – Rae, please give us your background. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">2:25 – Chuck: Tina’s interview will go live later on another episode. It’s interesting </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">How did you get into coding?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">2:50 – Rae: I started on a course 4 or 5 years ago. I moved to Akron, Ohio with the WOMEN and TECH group here, and got involved with the group. Free code camp and so on. Through meeting this Meetup I found a new position. This led to Angular development. I enjoyed the DevOps, but this Toll Wave is awesome! I have been working there for 9-10 months.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">4:45 – Chuck: Why <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s3">Angular</span></a> and not Vue or Java?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">4:52 – Rae: I started a side project with Angular with friends. They had a strong view with Angular, because Angular dealt with a lot of security issues. Since then I am pretty solid on the Angular side. The React side, I guess, is cool. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">5:53 – Chuck: People tend to go towards technologies that they can get help with. It makes sense why you went with Angular. Is there anyone specific that got you into Angular? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">6:23 – Rae: I didn’t have a network at the time. The 2 people that got me into Angular actually weren’t developers. I started with Docs and the <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial"><span class="s3">Heroes</span></a> actually were a great resource. It covers these pieces that are necessary to know how it works. I used early on NG docs, too.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">7:24 – Chuck: Actually that is organized by...</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">7:42 – Chuck: Getting your job is very interesting. I a m writing a book on how to find a job as a software developer. I see that people are struggling with this. What did you have in place to show them that you were capable for the job?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">8:18 – Rae: The interview was very conversational. It wasn’t algorithm tests; nothing super fancy. It really got into the work I’ve done and my thought process. I appreciated that the interview was realistic. I can go back to other traditionally other interview were “tougher.” I had to do an algorithm test. I sat down and I was terrified for that. It was more “simple” for the entry-level people. The saving grace is if you are frozen – just talk about the process. They want to see how you would talk through the process – they want to see that. You just have to know people. This Twitter job happened because of a network effect.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">10:19 – Chuck: Yes, very true. It is a lot easier to get a job that someone can just introduce you to the company then trying to do it all yourself. Creating those opportunities through the people you know.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">10:56 – Chuck: What are you doing now? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">11:01 – Rae: Financial management application. It’s secret right now. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In my free time, it is very hard to push through one thing. The latest thing I have been doing lately is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/"><span class="s3">Rust Programming Book</span></a>. I have talked with my director that I enjoy Angular but I don’t want to do just frontend. He’s been really great about it. He’s talking with other program managers to get involved with other projects that are coming in. I have tried to look at React. I cannot make myself do it. If you are good at one, then why would you learn the other one? Only reason to learn React is if I want a React job. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">13:12 – Chuck: People say to me that they want to stay current and also job availability. If my current situation changes then I can adopt any technology that they change to.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">13:58 – Rae: I have been wanting to look at Vue. I don’t know anything about Vue other than the inventor of it. It would be fun to play with the differences. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">14:42 – Chuck adds his comments.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">14:50 – Rae: There are so many different things out there to learn! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Different languages – it’s hard to limit myself to limited languages within a 40-minute talk. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">I spoke at the following conferences recently: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">1.) <a href="https://speakers.codemash.org/test/speakers.htm"><span class="s3">Codemash in Ohio</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">2.) Meetups in Grand Rapids (Software Craftsmanship)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">3.) Self Conference in Detroit (no recordings)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">4.) <a href="https://www.fullstackfest.com/speakers/raekrantz/"><span class="s3">Full Stack Fest in Barcelona</span></a> – the best conference ever because it was so well organized. The attention to detail was amazing. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">17:09 – Chuck adds his comments.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yeah we will encourage people to look into your talks!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">17:24 – Rae: Neat!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rae talks about workshops and typical <a href="https://www.meetup.com"><span class="s3">Meetups.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Cleveland area – October 6</span><span class="s7"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> – learn how to code – it will be fun!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">18:25 – Chuck: <a href="http://ng-girls.org"><span class="s3">ngGirls.org</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">18:40 – Chuck: Any advice for someone getting into tech?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">18:50 – Rae: Do it before you have kids. Your energy is at a low when you have kids and you don’t have the energy to work on the things you want to work on. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you don’t have kids then use your Netflix time now and STUDY! </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If I can get through a chapter a day – that is fantastic – with life with kids. I work through lunches a lot. I try to use my day care time with care. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s great to be at a conference without a kid.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">22:06 – Chuck: I have 5 kids. My oldest is 12 – so that is fine, but my youngest is 3. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The way we do it is I travel more than my wife. She’s a trooper to take care of the kids. I send her on a trip to see her best friend in North Carolina.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">22:52 – Chuck: People are paying attention to people have different circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">23:06 – Chuck: The last thing I want to ask is anything you are looking forward to in the future? Where do you want to wind-up?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">23:25 – Rae talks about her hopes and dreams.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rae: The puzzle aspect, I like. I like making things work together. The larger scope is what I like. In terms of the languages I take as they come.<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/"><span class="s3"> Rust</span></a>, yes, I would like to use that a few years down the line. It’s funny – I would learn React if I had to use it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I want to get in-depth in a few areas of <a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s3">Angular.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">24:43 – Chuck: Check out these technologies through these podcasts. I echo what you are saying on these 3 frameworks. I am having fun with Vue right now. It really depends on what you want and what you need. Go play with them all!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Chuck talks about <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s3">Vue,</span></a><a href="https://angular.io"><span class="s3"> Angular</span></a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com"><span class="s3">Java.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">25:31 – Chuck: Picks! </span></p>
