This episode dives into how to create a story around you and your business. Freelancers can use the tool of storytelling to impact culture and business. Branden guides the listener through shaping a story, the elements of the story, and how to connect with your audience.

Some of the areas we dig deep on in this episode are:
<ul>
 	<li>Honing in your clients' stories and how to be a facilitator of the story</li>
 	<li>How to uniquely position yourself  and your process and inject them into their story.</li>
 	<li>The structure of a good story. The form, the tension, the obstacles, etc.</li>
 	<li>and much much more...</li>
</ul>
