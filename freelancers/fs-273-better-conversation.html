In this episode of the Freelancer’s Show, Reuven, Jonathan, and Kai discuss “Why” conversations. Jonathan outlines that, “Why” calls are the preliminary conversations of a sale call. To understand the underlying purpose of why the client wants to engage in a project with you. This is a great episode to understand how to pivot a project to increase the value of your time using a fixed rated. Also to ensure the prospect is a good fit for skills and rates.

 	<li>Throwing objections at then customers to bring all considerations to surface</li>
 	<li>Understanding why now?</li>
 	<li>Urgency is the key to the project?</li>
 	<li>Why hire someone like me?</li>
 	<li>Confidence to get paid what you want</li>
 	<li>Hourly rates? Market rate? Fixed pricing.</li>
 	<li>Is hourly billing bad for the project?</li>
 	<li>Newbies are quick to jump.</li>
 	<li>Delivering ROI.</li>
 	<li>Back Seat Driving to nowhere</li>
 	<li>Predict Churn</li>
 	<li>Constantly reminding them of the goal and be the guardian of the project</li>
 	<li>What is the benefit of the project?</li>
 	<li>Make it clear you don’t work for an hourly rate</li>
 	<li>Productize service, value-based pricing, etc.</li>
