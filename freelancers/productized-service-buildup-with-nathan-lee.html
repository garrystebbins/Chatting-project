Nathan saw how many developers don't usually worry about making a repeatable process. There stands a need to build a deployment pipeline to make things easier. Another idea is the migration to another platform.
<h2>Call for Awareness</h2>
Nathan has the expertise to provide a solution. Unfortunately, not a lot of people see the need. What many don't realize is that many of the problems with inconsistent deployment is because someone didn't follow the step.
