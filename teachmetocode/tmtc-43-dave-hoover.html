Our guest this week is Dave Hoover. He's a member of the Software Craftsmanship movement. He's the Chief Craftsman at <a href="http://obtiva.com">Obtiva</a>. He's also written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596518382?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596518382">Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596518382" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> The most exciting part, was learning about apprenticeship from the guy who wrote the book.

Dave got started by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201733862?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0201733862">Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201733862" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

He also mentioned a few people that he considered masters:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://processpeoplepods.blogspot.com/">Fred George</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Uncle Bob Martin</a></li>
	<li>Corey Haines</li>
</ul>

There's some great advice on figure out where you are and determining where you can get to and how.
