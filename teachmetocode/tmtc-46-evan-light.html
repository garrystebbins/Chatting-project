This week's podcast guest is Evan Light. I met Evan at the Ruby|Web Conference at Snowbird. He's responsible for <a href="https://github.com/elight/coulda">Coulda</a> and the <a href="http://rubydcamp.org/">Ruby DCamp</a>.

Evan recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814473741?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0814473741">Get Clients Now!(TM): A 28-Day Marketing Program for Professionals, Consultants, and Coaches</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0814473741" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (affiliate link) for marketing as a freelancer.

We talked about organizing a conference and what it takes. 

He also had some great suggestions for people thinking about switching to freelance.

I also found his discussion of why he wrote Coulda very interesting. It inspires me to think that if I want something different, I can create it.
