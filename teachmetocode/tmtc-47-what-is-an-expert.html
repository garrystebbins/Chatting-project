I've been reading the Software Craftsmanship mailing list where they were discussing whether software is a craft. Someone brought up the concept of what makes a "Master Craftsman" in software and I started thinking about how to determine if someone is an expert or master.

There are a few concepts out there including these:

<ul>
	<li>Someone who has read at least 3 books on a subject.</li>
	<li>Someone who knows more about a subject than someone else.</li>
	<li>Someone who has published something on a topic.</li>
	<li>As discussed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356050">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware (Pragmatic Programmers)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1934356050" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

</ul>

Here are my thoughts on the subject.
