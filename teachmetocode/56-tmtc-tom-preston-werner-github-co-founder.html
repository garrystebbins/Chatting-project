Tom Preston-Werner is one of the founders of Github.com. He's a Ruby programmer who has successfully launched a business used by hundreds of thousands of programmers all over the world to host their programming projects. He is also the original developer behind Gravatar.

We discussed how <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> got started. Tom also mentioned <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>, <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org">god</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.

We also discussed open source software, contributing, hiring developers, and what makes Github such a great place to work. If you want some good pointers about how things should work at a development shop, I recommend this episode.
