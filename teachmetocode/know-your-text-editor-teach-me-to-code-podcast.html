Over the last few weeks I've been using <a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/wiki">macvim</a> and <a href="http://github.com/carlhuda/janus">janus</a> to write code. The more I learn about VIM, the more I love it.

It's not so much that VIM does things that I find particularly natural or "better", but rather it's that it's extremely powerful for opening, managing, and editing files. Each little trick I get brings me more and more to the place where I can code as fast as I can think.

The more I get to know about my text editor, the better off I am.
