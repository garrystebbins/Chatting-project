He and several others have helped organize Ruby conferences around the world, most notably <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>, RubyConf, and RubyConf India. He has also written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356344?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chamaxwoo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1934356344">The Passionate Programmer</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356344" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" /> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977616606?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chamaxwoo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0977616606">Rails Recipes</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0977616606" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" />. Finally, he has contributed to open source projects like <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> and <a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker</a>.

Chad is an organizer at <a href="http://rubycentral.org">Ruby Central</a> which is a non-profit which provides support to the Ruby community. Among other things, they provide a <a href="http://static.rubycentral.org/rcg2006.pdf">Regional Conference Grant</a> which local conferences like <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org">Mountain West RubyConf</a> can take advantage of.

He told me a bit about his inspiration for writing The Passionate Programmer and his experience working in India. The Passionate Programmer is about fulfillment in programming and work. It lays out a methodology for managing your career.

We discuss the paths that a career can take and things that people should consider as they move through their career.

One example he gives is from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307389839?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chamaxwoo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307389839">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307389839" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important" />. He talks about what we do when we have to do it to succeed, versus what we do when "success" comes naturally.

Overall, there was a lot of great information in the interview. I'd like to thank Chad for coming onto the show and for all of his hard work in the Ruby and Rails communities.
