This week's episode is an interview with Corey Haines. He's pretty well known as the Software Journeyman and his coding tours where he traded time pairing on code for room and board.

You can keep up with him at <a href="http://coreyhaines.com">http://coreyhaines.com</a>.

Here's a link to the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship Manifesto</a> which is tied a lot to the discussion we had on Software Craftsmanship.

Corey mentioned the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262510871?ie=UTF8&tag=chamaxwoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262510871">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=chamaxwoo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0262510871" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 book, which is a mind-blowing set of instruction and exercises for computer programmers.

We also discussed pairing in relation to the code retreats. Corey mentioned the paper by Arlo Belshee called <a href="http://mitchlacey.com/docs/XR4PromiscuousPairingandBeginnersMind.pdf">"Promiscuous Pairing and the Beginner's Mind"</a>
