Transcript

[This show is sponsored by The Pragmatic Studio. The Pragmatic Studio has been teaching iOS development since November of 2008. They have a 4-day hands-on course where you'll learn all the tools, APIs, and techniques to build iOS Apps with confidence and understand how all the pieces fit together. They have two courses coming up: the first one is in July, from the 22nd - 25th, in Western Virginia, and you can get early registration up through June 21st; you can also sign up for their August course, and that's August 26th - 29th in Denver, Colorado, and you can get early registration through July 26th. If you want a private course for teams of 5 developers or more, you can also sign up on their website at pragmaticstudio.com.]

CHUCK: Hey everybody and welcome to Episode 17 of The iPhreaks Show! This week on our panel, we have Pete Hodgson.

PETE: Hello, hello from San Francisco!

CHUCK: Jaim Zuber.

JAIM: Hello from Minneapolis!

CHUCK: Andrew Madsen.

ANDREW: Hi from Salt Lake City!

CHUCK: Rod Schimdt.

ROD: Hello, hello from Salt Lake!

CHUCK: I’m Charles Max Wood from DevChat.tv. This week we have a special guest, and that is Brandon Alexander.

BRANDON: Hello! I’m coming from Atlanta, Georgia.

CHUCK: Since you haven’t been on the show before, do you want to give us a brief introduction, let us know who you are?

BRANDON: I’m currently a iOS and hopefully Mac developer for Black Pixel. I do a lot of the client development work and test as much as I can a lot of our products. I’m also an author, a conference speaker, and I’ve also done a training video to appear soon.

CHUCK: Nice! Sounds like fun! What book did you write? I’m curious…

BRANDON: The book I wrote is called “Pro iOS 5 Tools”. It’s a couple of versions of iOS old, but the techniques in the book are still completely valid today.

CHUCK: Very nice. Alright, we’ll tell people to go check it out. We brought you on the show to talk about “Performance Tuning” for your iOS app. I think it’s interesting; we’re talking about a resource-constrained environment. Is it about the user’s experience? Or, are there other concerns as well that we’re trying to optimize for?

BRANDON: Ultimately, it’s about the user experience. If you try to implement something and the user doesn’t have a good experience with it, or it does something over the phone like battery life, you might want to rethink that feature or rethink the assumptions of your application.
