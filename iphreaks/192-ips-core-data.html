<h2>192 iPS Core Data</h2>
On today's episode, Andrew and Jaim discuss <strong>Core Data</strong>. Core Data is now easy to use as a result of the recent changes in Xcode 8 and iOS 10. Learn what it is and understand how you can get the most out of it.
<h2>What is Core Data?</h2>
Core Data was released along with macOS 10.4 in 2005. It is Apple's framework for doing local persistence.

With it, you can track changes, save disks, manage relationships, and undo and redo stack. You can easily manage object relationships without having to write code manually.
<h2>Core Data vs. SQL</h2>
Unlike SQL, Core Data can turn database into objects. It can also maintain relationships between the objects. As programmer, you deal with different objects and properties. Core Data keeps the relationships valid.
<h2>Appropriate Use</h2>
Core Data is more efficient in large data sets. You can use it if you're finding it difficult to manage object relationships.

It has a free built-in support for undo and redo. You can undo something without a code. You just need to hook it in the system.
