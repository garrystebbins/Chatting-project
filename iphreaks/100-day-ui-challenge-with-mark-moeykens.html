<h2>100 Day UI Challenge with Mark Moeykens</h2>
Are you up for the <strong>100 Day UI Challenge with Mark Moeykens</strong>? Mark has been developing since 1996, and works mostly on backend and UI. He got into iPhone development few years ago. Recently, he took up a challenge to get better at UI. Tune in to know how you too can join!
<blockquote>“All the information you see on the UI don't have the same value. Some of them are more important than the other pieces, and you want them to stand out more.” -Mark Moeykens</blockquote>
<h2>How to Join the UI Challenge</h2>
To join, simply go to DailyUi.co, and sign up with your email address. Every weekday, you will receive an email that prompts you to do something creative. The good thing is you can apply them to a lot of things.

You can choose your own format and tools. The challenge is there for you to practice on. Once you complete one, you get to share it on Twitter or Dribble.
<h2>Practicing with Xcode</h2>
Mark did the challenge in Xcode. He wanted to make it more challenging. A lot of times he sees great UI which aren't really practical.

He wants to create something realistic. And, every day that he does the challenge he gets fast in doing Xcode.
<h2>Advance Your Skills and Knowledge</h2>
Mark started the challenge to learn more about implementation and design. He only knows the basics, such as taking the tools from the toolbox and placing them on the storyboard.

He had no design experience as well. Human Interface Guidelines and Material Design for Android are the only resources he learned from. Eventually he researched and tried to learn on his own.
