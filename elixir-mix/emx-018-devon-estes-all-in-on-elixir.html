<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Special Guest:</b></span><span class="s2"> Devon Estes</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Devon Estes. He is an American programmer located in Berlin, Germany. Devon is coaching on <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>, and his background is on Ruby Rails. Check-out today’s episode to hear how passionate Devon is about the Elixir program, and what he loves about it.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">3:58 – Devon finds that the process of writing helps him find “bugs”. He tries to write once a month on various topics, such as what he has learned, and his freelancing work. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">4:50 – One of the panelists says that he also writes, too, and how it helps him process what is going on. He treats it like a research paper, because he wants it to sound coherent. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">5:43 – Devon used to work in PR and Marketing. What he learned from those fields is that: visibility creates opportunity. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">7:19 – When you choose the technology, it’s about how easy previous resources to help support that if it’s the right tech. Finding <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a> developers is hard to find. Elixir ahs been that way for a while, but actually it is becoming the new and improved Ruby. You get the 10X productivity, but you aren’t held up by some factors. Have you ever had finding work in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">8:22 – Devon: Not in the last year-and-a-half. Being a freelancer, stay visible, because you are constantly looking for different projects, and so on. There are other countries out there where <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a> is more prominent than compared to the United States. Companies in San Francisco are having a hard time finding Elixir developers to work with them. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">10:31 – How was your transition from <a href="https://rubyonrails.org"><span class="s3">Ruby</span></a> to <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a> and your writing projects? How did you go down that path?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">11:07 – Devon: The more I wrote in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a> the more he liked the program. Ruby inspired <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>, for sure. He likes how it’s comprehensive to him, and how productive he is with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>. For Devon, it fits well with how he writes code; and because he’s happy, his clients are happy, too. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir’s</span></a> language fits well with his way of thinking and there are other benefits for Devon by working with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>. Devon likes feeling productive and it fulfills his needs. Finally, he also really enjoys the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a> community!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">16:51 – What do you not like about <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">16:55 – Devon: He found his first thing he doesn’t love about <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a>, and he found it today, of all things! Listen to this timestamp to see what Devon shares. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">20:47 – Question asked for Devon: How are other languages doing that, and what can we do to make that happen?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">20:53 – Check-out Devon’s answer!</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s4">24:11 – <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><span class="s5">Digital Ocean’s Mid-Roll Advertisement</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">24:48 – Devon continues his answer from 20:53. Programmers talk and, when more people are having certain experiences, the word is going to get out. The flexibility of the language is going to be great in the long run. Great sales pitch.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">26:47 – Josh, you have a lot of experience of the years, pushing the eco-system, have you seen a pick-up from that or has it grown, how have you seen your involvement in these projects helped with the awareness...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">27:19 – Josh: I don’t know how much of an influence I have, but it has doubled almost every year. Of course, this won’t happen every year, and at some time it will plateau. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"><span class="s3">Elixir</span></a> is rapidly growing now, though. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">28:09 – Question to Devon: Let’s talk about your project, <a href="https://github.com/devonestes/fast-elixir"><span class="s3">Fast Elixir</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">28:16 – Devon talks about how he got involved with Fast Elixir and how it developed. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">31:19 – Let’s talk about Benchy.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">31:28 – Devon: We are very proud of it. Devon continues in detail about the before-mentioned question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">36:30 – Question to Devon – Let’s talk about reductions, so people can understand it better.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">36:41 – Think of a reduction that it’s one thing the virtual thing does. It has a counter, and it does a certain number of things before it needs to take a break. That’s the most basic unit. One reduction is one instruction and it counts that. That’s how it manages its internal scheduler. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">38:20 – Chuck: When you adopted Ruby did you feel the same way about it like you do about Elixir. Chuck says, “I totally get it...” It’s more a learning opportunity for Chuck. Have you found the next best thing? Or...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">39:06 – Devon was an opera singer for a while, and studied at the Manhattan School of Music. Check out his full bio in LinkedIn, and other social media profiles. As Devon became an advanced programmer he started to develop his programming skills. He tried JavaScript, but the language didn’t appeal to him. The more he experienced in different programs, he found that the bigger picture for him boiled down to the community aspect for him. He could have fallen in-love with <a href="https://clojure.org"><span class="s3">Clojure</span></a>, but he’s not quite sure. Finally, it basically was the Elixir’s language and the community that he likes.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">45:05 – It’s neat to see the progression that you went through. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">45:25 – Let’s do picks!</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s4">45:30 – <a href="http://codebadge.org/"><span class="s5">Code Badges' Advertisement!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">46:11 – Picks! </span></p>
