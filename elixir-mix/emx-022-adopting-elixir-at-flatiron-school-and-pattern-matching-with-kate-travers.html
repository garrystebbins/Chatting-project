<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katettravers"><span class="s4">Kate Travers</span></a> who was a student/apprentice with the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/campuses/nyc/?utm_campaign=gmb&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic"><span class="s4">Flatiron School</span></a> and now is on staff as a software engineer. The panel and Kate talk about adopting Elixir at the Flatiron School and Pattern Matching. Watch Kate’s talks about the topic; <a href="https://youtu.be/FXjpHRMsERI"><span class="s4">links to these talks can be found below. </span></a></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:08– Hi from Kate Travers. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">1:16 – Chuck: Background? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:20 – Kate gives her background. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:30 – Chuck: We had another Flatiron alum from an extra show.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:44 – Kate: Yeah – she’s great!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">2:48 – Chuck: <a href="https://flatironschool.com/campuses/nyc/?utm_campaign=gmb&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic"><span class="s4">Flatiron</span></a> mostly focused on Ruby and JavaScript. Has that changed or?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">3:02 – Kate: For the students we are teaching the Rails focus on the backend and React on the frontend. Times might be changing. What else is out there for functional curriculum? Our lead engineer is super motivated introducing some Elixir. Our engineering team might be the first to go in that arena. It would be absolutely fantastic to </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">4:02 – Chuck: Awesome! I would like to see the boot camps take on Elixir.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">4:15 – Kate: Yeah, there are many benefits of doing that. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">4:57 – Chuck: You see some Reactive, some...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">It is interesting to see how it comes together and </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">5:16 – Kate: Yeah we see this as a support – delivery of curriculum. When you start out you are writing in a functional style. You are essentially writing TLI scripts – functional manner. Now in the curriculum we are training people to think, and to get away from that script-way, and think in terms of objects.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">6:11 – Panelist: I think that is interesting.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Some of the difficulty of teaching Elixir is to UNLEARN some of their past education. Start teaching people FUNCTIONAL, might help. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:04 – Chuck: I have been starting a new project...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">What is going on here? Oh yeah I have to think about it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">7:20 – Kate: Yes. We have spun up – we have one core Elixir project. We have been on that for a year. We have spun up some smaller projects. On these projects this is the first time these people have used Elixir. It is interesting to see the difficulties that they are seeing for the first time. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">8:09 – Chuck: I want to talk to adoption for a bit. So as your school has made this transition, where are you seeing the (first of all) where is it easy to get buy in. How did Elixir get into Flatiron?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">9:06 – Kate: It is not apart of the school’s curriculum. How we started using Elixir was because our technical lead he is super loud / elegant voice for this language. Elixir might solve some of the problems that we were facing. When we adopt new tech it’s because we have thought about it heavily. We don’t adopt new technologies “just because”. The perfect opportunity came up, so this lead into why and how Flatiron started using Elixir. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Kate goes into more detail.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:24 – Chuck: Learn.io – check out outside of the school?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">15:35 – Kate: Yep! There is even some interview prep; also, intro to Ruby, intro to JavaScript, and someday intro to Elixir? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">16:06 – Chuck: As you brining people into this how do you transfer them to Ruby to Elixir? Do you throw them into the deep end?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">16:26 – Kate: Sure! If someone is interested we will. It is something our team tries to prioritize. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Kate goes into more detail.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">18:43 – Kate: We didn’t expect for these book clubs to keep going. We will do a little workshop as part of book club.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">19:18 – Panelist: Question to Kate.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">19:25 – Kate: Yes, so everyone has a NEW lead each week. Folks of ALL different experience levels. What is different about our team is that we have tons of people who LOVE to blog. If you check-it out as they are learning Elixir they are writing posts. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:21 – Question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:29 – Kate answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:49 – Chuck.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">20:55 – Kate: Steven suggested a new way to cement the things you are learning. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">21:28 – Chuck: Yeah – Flatiron labs. Now that I have been playing with Elixir with pattern matching. At first it’s scary stuff.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">21:49 – Kate: It is a head-trip.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:00 – Chuck: ...wait...wait...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:10 – Kate: Multiple binding?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:16 – Panelist: My first introduction to outer matching was seeing a...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">22:39 – Kate: Great first introduction. Not the textbook example, you will get to see the real-world situation. Yeah that is a really, really good example.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">23:05 – Panelist: Pattern matching for me became a superpower! It was my first real love of the language; before concurrency, and others. Pattern matching helped with a lot of the pains that I wouldn’t have to encounter. You are poking this big object to figure it out. Then it’s easier because if the shape matches, then it matches. Mental flip – and I get it! It felt like a superpower. I liked your talk, Kate, about pattern matching.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">24:41 – Kate: Yeah, totally. <a href="https://kate-travers.com/pattern-matching/"><span class="s4">Pattern matching.</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Like learning a musical instrument like a guitar. When you start learning something like this you have these high ambitions. You are learning to be a rock star and you want to be David Bowie. But when you start you couldn’t be further away from that goal. At the beginning you are learning chords and it’s so easy to think: “I am terrible, I suck...” you quit and never keep going. To prevent this you need a hook to keep you going. You just need to learn that really sick rift. Oh yeah, NOW I can start seeing my rock star abilities; same thing for Elixir. Pattern matching was my really sick rift. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">27:38 – Panelist chimes-in. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">You have that excitement about the new language. But they get frustrated because they are a beginner. I do think that you nailed it there. If people can latch onto something fairly quickly, then it gives them a reason to keep coming back to learn more and more.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">28:25 – Kate continues this conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">28:48 – Panelist. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">28:54 – Advertisement – <a href="http://codebadge.org/"><span class="s4">Code Badges!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">29:32 – Chuck: Most important / interesting thing you’ve learned about pattern matching?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">29:48 – Kate: It was the different things you can do with...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">30:23 – Kate: The concept is that Elixir provides...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">31:42 – Chuck: I didn’t know that you could do that!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">31:56 – Kate: The benefit only comes from legibility. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">32:13 – Panelist: Guard clauses and pattern matching. I think it would be a mess if I weren’t use Elixir. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">32:31 – Kate: Yes, definitely. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">33:10 – Panelist: Yes, my first project with Elixir...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">34:47 – People should go and see your talk and it’s in the links. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">35:00 – Kate: Thanks!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Kate talks about dodging bullets and code. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">36:04 – Chuck: have you seen other languages using/trying to use Pattern matching?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">36:10 – Kate: Yeah, there are talks about Ruby and JavaScript for introducing proper pattern matching in BOTH languages. Ruby is interesting. I don’t know how much traction we have on these, but people seem really into program matching.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">36:36 – Panelist: Yeah, I think people come to Elixir and see pattern matching and they get excited.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">36:55 – Kate: Yeah, I would be interested to see if the proposals go through or not. There is a conference on my WATCH LIST and I want to see more about it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">37:26 – Panelist: It started off as a prologue that’s what you need.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">37:37 – Kate: If it wasn’t designed that way in the beginning it will be a problem. If it’s not apart of the system in the beginning then it could be a problem. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">38:14 – Chuck: Yeah, the flipside is...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">38:34 – Panelists: I don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">38:44 – Panelist: One of my concerns is object oriented programming. I imagine (nightmare) pattern matching in Ruby and all match onto this object – after it’s there – it’s inside my function – runs another thread – comes back to me – that object is modified and now it’s there, and not be completely invalid. It’s not RUBY anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">39:36 – Panelist: Pattern matching could bring them over and bring them over the gap. I am worried that if this is more widespread then we will hit a much worse.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">40:06 – Kate and Panel: Yep!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">40:12 – Chuck: Anything else about pattern matching and/or adopting Elixir? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">40:18 – Kate: I don’t want to rush into this too quickly, but if we are on the topic of bringing people to Elixir. It came up at this conference. Ruby Rails coming over – RR refugees. The question that they post: People are hyped about Elixir about Phoenix. What is going to be the thing that brings people over? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">41:15 – Panelist answers Kate’s question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">41:29 – You can’t do live Vue in other languages. If you are really experienced...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">42:08 – Chuck: You have to learn 2 technologies. You can adopt a frontend and backend technology and you can get SOME of that. I know a lot of people are invested in the frontend technology or the backend. I think that is how you are going to convert.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">42:43: Panelist chimes-in. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Panelist’s friend asks: Is it an appropriate tool? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">43:30 – Kate: Our team is super excited about it. Our team has mostly been working on the backend. We need to deliver on the frontend with updates. What if we had it – out of the box with Phoenix? Yeah people are over the moon.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">44:06 – Chuck talks about what he is using. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">What if I didn’t have to do any of that garbage?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">44:23 – Panelist: It is a NICE experience when you have to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">44:38 – Chuck: If you need a killer feature for React or Vue – why can’t you build a frontend...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">45:00 – Panelist adds in his comments/thoughts. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">45:30 – Chuck: Anything else?</span></p>
