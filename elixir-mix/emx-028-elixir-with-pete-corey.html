<p class="p5"><span class="s5">0:00 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s6">Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:50 – Mark: Welcome! Our panel is Josh Adams and our guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/petecorey"><span class="s6">Pete Corey</span></a>! Pete, can you tell people about yourself?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:12 – <a href="https://twitter.com/petecorey"><span class="s6">Guest:</span></a> I am a software developer and I run a web development consultancy company. I use Node and React, and I use Elixir in my free time, and I blog about that and various projects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:38 – Mark: How did you get into Elixir? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:40 – Guest: Node has its limitations. I found myself not understanding concurrency at all. I saw Elixir and I came around to it when it was around its 1.0 era. I have been hooked ever since.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:43 – <i>Josh asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:00 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:42 – Josh: Yeah it felt like I was putting a s</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:03 – Mark: Letting the mantra of letting it fail or let it crash. How do I recover? You are mentioning about your Node situation that you have these complex situations and how do I get back to a good running state. That’s what I like about Elixir. I’m more concerned: how do I get back to a good running state. It’s a mental shift and I really appreciate it. Instead of worrying about this half, I am focusing more on how do I use it to make it run smoothly?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">5:20 – Guest: I totally agree. Learning Elixir has really flipped my mind about developing. I know failure happens – figure it how it fails and then anticipating HOW they might fail to make things easier. In terms of bigger projects...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest talks about the BIG project he is working on now! Listen here!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:40 – Panel: That sounds cool! Are you building this by yourself or with other people?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:54 – Guest: It’s a solo project and I want to keep it that way. I was into <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388"><span class="s6">Bitcoin</span></a> before and I bought Mastering <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388"><span class="s6">Bitcoin</span></a>. Started working through that – how to go through private keys and things like that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:40 – Panel: I think that it’s great that you are SHARING through the process. I think that’s awesome and you are showing what you are learning and the pitfalls and the gains. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:11 – Guest: It’s been a learning process with pattern matching. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:20 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:30 – Guest talks about bytes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:59 – Panel: One of the first things I did in Elixir was...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:27 – Guest: ...moving bytes around and moving integers and things like that. Elixir is much nicer!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:40 – Panel: Can you talk about <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html"><span class="s6">Gen TCP</span></a>, please?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:55 – Guest: A goal of my project tis to dig into the underlining Erlang properties. I think it’s a shame that people don’t explore this. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The guest talks about what <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html"><span class="s6">Gen TCP</span></a> is!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:38 – Panel: I like using Gen TCP. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:54 – Guest: Every problem that I had boiled down to my lack of knowledge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:29 – Panel: What do you mean: it worked out better?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:35 – Guest: My Gen TCP connection would pass to the...the issue is that Gen TCP is a streaming protocol. It might contain multiple packets or 1½ packets, etc. Every time I received some data I would impend it to a buffer and I would look for head eliminators. After that would be the packet length and I would split that number of bytes from the original buffer. That’s hard to explain, but...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest talks about a solution!!</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:21 – Panel: I think there are a few great points there. One, Erlang has a lot of rich history. What are available through Erlang already? Join the Elixir Slack Channel! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">17:34 – Panel: Sounds like you are using property testing? I think that’s cool – I want to spend more time digging into this! What is it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">18:00 – Guest: It is pretty cool and new to me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i>The guest talks about unit testing and then property testing. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:20 – Panel: What kind of experience have you had?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">20:40 – <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/?ref=ppc-fb&amp;campaignid=717543354&amp;adgroupid=51893696397&amp;targetid=kwd-298507762065&amp;crid=284659279616&amp;dv=c&amp;ntwk=g&amp;source=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqISmqeLh3gIVizRpCh28EQ75EAAYASAAEgJYmPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"><span class="s6">Fresh Books!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:48 – Guest: The one place where I am using property testing is...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:41 – Panel: That’s awesome. I want to get into it more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">23:50 – Guest: Once I get going it falls together pretty easily. It’s hard to come up with the properties that I want to test.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:11 – Guest: It’s far more eye opening than unit testing. When you have to think about these fundamental properties you see in a different light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:33 – Panel: I am dropping in a link to your blog articles that you tagged. Is there anything else you want to say about your project?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:55 – Guest: It’s an ongoing project. I haven’t actually implemented the meat of the project, yet. Please stay tuned!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:25 – Panel: Is it your website: petecorey.com?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:35 – Guest: Yes www.petecorey/blog.com and my newsletter!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:47 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:55 – <i>Guest asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:05 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:12 – Panel: What else to talk about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:40 – Guest: There is another project to talk about and it’s about guitar chords and things like that; if you want? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:57 – Panel: Yeah, generating music with Elixir is simple. I know you did the distance between chords thing? What else is super cool about it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">27:27 – Guest: It programmatically generates these guitar chords. The coolest piece is the algorithm all of guitar fingers for a guitar chord and fret this fret, etc. Then I can take the chord with a specific fingering and measure the distance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:30 – Panel: Have you seen Google Wave Net? It’s fairly recent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:39 – Guest: Is it related to Google Labs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:47 – Panel: I doubt it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:18 – Guest: Very cool, but I don’t have the AI chops. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:26 – Panel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:29 – Guest: Yeah it works my brain a bit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:40 – Guest: Yeah I play too much guitar. I had enough money to buy my own guitar and amp.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:54 – Panel: Talk about the chord charts. I was looking for the word: tablature! </span></p>
