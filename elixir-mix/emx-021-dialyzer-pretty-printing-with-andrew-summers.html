<p class="p4"><span class="s2">In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Andrew Summers who lives in Chicago, currently. Working on Elixir development, and here to talk about how he wrote the dialyzer pretty printer. He is a software engineer for Albert.io, makes cool stuff every day, loves punk music, and Philadelphia sports. The panel talks about the Dialyzer pretty printing, Elixir, code writing, and more!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1:07 – Why are you famous?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1:11 – Andrew: Answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1:34 – Chuck: Nice. Is the dialyzer printer complete pretty printing or is it more than that? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1:45 – Andrew talks. He mentions the background information on this specific printer, which was written a decade ago.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">4:13 – Panel: One thing that is helpful is that it is a static code analysis. In the Elixir we are writing these spec statements. For nothing else than this type is coming out. Then this looks at the code, and your spec says you are returning this, but I can tell that you are also returning X, Y, or Z. So it is helping us see what we are declaring a code to do, and that’s really what the code is doing.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">5:28 – Guest: Yes, exactly. To continue that topic here is what else it’s saying...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">6:08 – Panel: Our panelist is not here, but he has had to fix code before with that problem. With Dialect Dialyzer – how do we say this library is out-of-date? The code is out-of-date. How do I get my stuff to pass – to clean up my site?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">6:54 – Guest: Containing that warning. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Guest goes into further detail how to problem-solve this issue. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">8:02 – Panel: So you are saying that I can funnel.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">8:20 – Panel &amp; Guest go back-and-forth talking about this topic.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">9:49 – Panel: I am still diving into the system. Haven’t really used the printer, yet.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Panelist asks Guest a question. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">10:04 – Guest: At the forefront there are some configurations to help with that. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">11:16 – Panel: Why would someone not want to use this? What are the cons? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">11:23 – Guest: It would have to do more with CI than anything (one con). </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">13:06 – Panel: Lots of people are coming to Elixir New. Great. What is the selling point? Why should someone invest his or her time in this project?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">13:33 – Guest: I find looking for a type spec is one more piece of information that could help the reader that would tell them what the code should be doing. Any information from the original author to be passed down is great. Having the machine to check that, whenever you push code, it’s an imperfect check (as we were saying). If it can tell you that you did something wrong, then why not? It gives you that extra red flag. There are huge benefits to that. Same reason we write unit tests. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">15:20 – Panel: You are learning Elixir right, Chuck? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Panelist talks about tech specs, code writing, and learning projects. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">16:25 – Panel: Here is a tip to learning. One thing that I did I came to an existing project and writing a sub-system ( as series of modules) Writing the tech specs. As they are interacting with each other, then writing Dial Elixir, and grab the output to the file path to where my code is. Within my own code find where I am inconsistent. Andrew – you could get pages of output, right? Any tips for users?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">17:37 – Guest: Isolate portions of your code base. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">19:27 – Chuck: I do like the idea of the umbrella. Phoenix app out into an umbrella. A sub apps and they are more centered, smaller sized. Then, yeah. Start with Dialyzer on just that project. Isolate it, and this app in the umbrella. The output is much smaller, and good success with that. Now, one of the new features you added was the language / the code that it reports is an ERLANG term. That is not familiar to most Elixir developers. Especially if you are new to it. If you are turning this into a friendly Elixir thing, then you had to learn other programs. How did you get into this path?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">21:00 – Andrew: Whenever there was complicated “something” at work – I was the person to go to. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">As I started to do it more and more I saw patterns in the output. Things were kind of predictable, and how to format things. It synchronizes weird. What would I do to write this task? Researched. There are 2 tools = <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/leex.html"><span class="s4">LEEX</span></a> and <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/yecc.html"><span class="s4">YECC</span></a>. If you have 2 files in your source directory...</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">23:39 – Panel: It’s cool.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">23:58 – Guest: It brought me back to some courses from school. I thought that was funny. They are pretty contained tools. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">24:36 – Panel: Part of your motivation was from Jose.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">24:49 – Guest: Yes, definitely.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">25:39 – Did you have any questions for Jose? </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">26:35 – Panel: You added the feature of...</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><a href="https://github.com/rrrene/credo">CREDO is pretty well-known.</a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">27:28 – Guest: Sure, I guess I did skip some of that. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Andrew talked about different libraries, ERLANG modules, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">28:38 – Panel: What else are you doing?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">28:45 – Getting error messages fixed for version 1.0. Trying to close-up the residual things. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">30:18 – Guest keeps talking about support and other bugs. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Andrew: If you see something, say something.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">31:00 - Panel: There are languages that run on the beam. Something to create something more standard so different languages can depend on. Is there anything like that? To help you with your tooling?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">31:40 – Andrew: Good question! Some of the things that happen at the Dialyzer level, stuff just gets dropped. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">33:47 – Guest: How this works all together...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">35:15 – Chuck: How to contribute to Dialyxir?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">35:30 – Guest: Around error messages – is the best place to look. If you have a good editor hand, good place for that. If you are further into the compiler land – might want to play with that. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">36:29 – Guest: <a href="https://github.com/asummers/erlex"><span class="s3">ERLEX</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">36:43 – Chuck: What did you learn about building these libraries?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">36:55 – Guest: I learned a lot about the construction of Elixir. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Guest dives into this more.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">38:25 – Chuck: The principle that you cannot bind...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">38:51 – Guest: ...this area of my code-base... it would be nice to turn off those features. When I really do need it – I need it, but not so if I don’t need it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">39:39 – Panel: I want to point someone to a resource: <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/typespecs.html"><span class="s3">TypeSpecs</span></a></span><span class="s6">.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">39:54 – Guest: I used that so much! Wonderful resource, I learned so much stuff! I stole all the output from that. I didn’t know that language had that?!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">40:20 – Panel chimes in about this resource some more.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">41:02 – Guest: We really do have a simple language. There are some weird things, but not a lot of constructs under the hood. Only a few data structures. It could have been more complicated. I was worried about that – but that never happened, because...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">41:41 – Panel: Thanks for adding that. Very true. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">42:51 – Guest talks about other things that are very simple, too. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">44:35 – Panel: Are you doing fulltime with Elixir for programming?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">44:35 – Guest: Yes, we are using other Elixir and JS App. In another life I used...</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">They all can teach you something. Sometimes the journey of going there and realizing WHY you don’t want to be there is sometimes worth the journey! </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">45:20 – Panel asks guest a question.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">45:25 – Guest answers question. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Andrew: We have enjoyed our time in Elixir. It’s nice. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">46:27 – Panel: Anything else?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">46:33 – Panel: Where can people find you online?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">46:40 – Guest: Elixir Slack, Twitter, GitHub. </span></p>
