<p class="p1"><span class="s2">0:52 – <a href="https://medium.com/@frosty/preparing-to-become-a-gde-752b551c88df"><span class="s4">Host:</span></a> Welcome! Today’s panel is myself, Brian, and our guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/amirtugi"><span class="s4">Amir Tugendhaft!</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:13 – Guest: I am a developer and experience with Angular and React. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1:56 – Host: You spend your days/nights there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:03 – Panel: He is committed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:08 – Host: I am going to back up a second, and Brian could you please introduce yourself, please?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:26 – <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_love?lang=en"><span class="s4">Brian:</span></a> I am the CETO at an Angular consulting firm (Denver, CO). We have the pleasure with working with Aaron from time-to-time. My Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_love?lang=en"><span class="s4">@brian_love</span></a> – check it out!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:52 – Host: What is CETO stand for?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2:59 – <i>Brian answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Brian: I oversee the crew among other things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:31 – Host: What do you want to talk about today, Amir? You are the guest of honor today!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3:40 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:00 – Host: That is a lot of information – that might be more than 1 episode. We have to stay focused!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:14 – Host: I read one of your recent blogs about Cross Filled Violators. I met you through your blog before we did the </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Host: Give us your own ideas about starting your own app.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4:50 – <i>Guest answers the question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6:17 – Host: I am biased. But here is a fact. I used to work on a large team (60 people) and everyone committing to the same page app. We were using Angular.js 1.5, which I think they are still using that. I know that it worked but it wasn’t the easiest or fastest one to maintain, but it worked. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:05 – Brian.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">7:10 – Host: What are you trying to do? React doesn’t fulfill that need. I think you are being hyperballic and using extreme cases as the norm. Let’s be honest: we do cool stuff with jQuery plugins when we didn’t have a framework. When they say that the framework is stopping them then I say: I agree to disagree.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:00 – Host: What do you think, Amir?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:04 – Guest: I don’t have preferences. I try to build applications through the technologies and create components and simple applications. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:30 – Brian.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">8:33 – Guest: You create the component, and then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:21 – Brian: You don’t have to have a template file and another file – right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:35 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">9:48 – Host: I do in-line styles and in-line templates. One thing I learned from React is that I like my HTML, style and code. I like it being the same file as my component. I like that about that: I like single file components. This promotes getting frustrated if it gets too big. Yeah if it’s more than 500 lines than you have to simplify. That’s one of the things that l like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:47 – Brian: Modules versus...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">10:55 – Guest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:07 – Host: I think in <a href="https://reactjs.org"><span class="s4">React</span></a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org"><span class="s4">Vue</span></a> you have the word module but in JavaScript you have a file that exports... </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">11:26 – Host: I have my opinion here and talking with Joe. He made a good point: at a certain level the frontend frameworks are the same. You could be doing different things but they basically do the same thing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">13:57 – Guest: Basically what that means is that the technology used it will do the same thing. Your patterns and practices are huge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">14:17 – Brian: If you are talking about the 3 popular frameworks out there – they are basically doing the same thing. I like Angular a little big more, though. Like you said, Aaron, people tend to pick the same one. I like the opinionated things about Angular. You get properties, components or called props or inputs you are getting a lot of the same features. It comes down to your personal preference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:31 – Host: What else Amir?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">15:35 – Guest: Let’s talk about the UI.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:05 – Brian.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:08 – <i>Guest asks a question.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:25 – Brian: How have you tackled this problem?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:34 – Guest: I kind of ran with it. If there wasn’t something that I liked I started from scratch, because it really didn’t feel right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">16:51 – Brian: I am an enemy of starting over type of thing. You have a lot of engineers who START projects, and they can say that they start this piece, but the experts and choice team members have what it takes to ship a feature. I mean fully ship it, not just 80%, but also the final 20%. I think it takes a lot of pose decision making to say I want to rewrite it but not right now. I still need to ship this code. I have always been a bigger fan as not rewriting as much as possible; however, if you started with good patterns then that’s true, but if you are starting off with bad patterns then maybe yes. I like that opinion b/c you have to start right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Brian: How do you do your CSS?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">19:05 – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-tugi/?originalSubdomain=il"><span class="s4">Guest.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s5">19:52 – <a href="https://devchat.tv/get-a-coder-job/"><span class="s3">Advertisement: Get A Coder Job!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:30 – Brian: How do you make those decisions, Amir?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">20:39 – Guest: I see something that I like and ask myself how do I apply this to my design and I start scaling things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">21:50 – Host: Are you using a tool like<a href="https://www.sketchapp.com"><span class="s4"> Sketch</span></a> for your initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design"><span class="s4">UI design?</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:05 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">22:54 – Host: I worked on a project where the client had a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ovj4hFxko7c"><span class="s4">designer (UX).</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:00 – <i>Host and Guest go back-and-forth.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">24:51 – Host: I am sure it’s all about the quality from your designer, too. Hopefully it works well for you and it’s quality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">25:18 – Host: There is a lot to building an app from scratch. I am not a good designer. I am not a designer – I mean straight-up. I got nothing. I appreciate team members that can do that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:06 – Guest: Do you write...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">26:35 – Host: Only on the most recent project. The designer didn’t own the HTML CSS but he initially wrote it and then gave it to me and now I own it, and it’s in components. If he wants updates then I have to go and make changes b/c he doesn’t know Angular. If it’s a sketch or a PNG you have to make it look like that. That’s what most of my career has been. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Host: HTML and CSS got me 762x easier once <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"><span class="s4">Flexbox</span></a> came around! I know there is a decimal there! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:23 – <i>Host talks about </i><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"><span class="s4"><i>Flexbox</i></span></a><i> some more.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:42 – <i>Guest asks a question.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">28:50 – Host: I suppose if I really had heavy needs for a table then I would try CSS grid could solve some problems. I might just use a styled table. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:12 – Brian: <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com"><span class="s4">ag-Grid</span></a> or something else. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">29:21 – Host: On this recent project...I’ve used in-house design and other things. If I ever needed a table it was there. I don’t rebuild components b/c that can get expensive for me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">30:50 – Brian: Accessibility. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:00 – Host: Your upgrade just got 10x harder b/c you own the component loop. I really don’t build tables or drop-downs. Only way is if I really need to build it for a specific request. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:30 – Brian.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">31:58 – Host: Let me give you an example. You can think I am crazy, but a designer gave me a drop-down but he told me to use <a href="https://codeburst.io/why-not-primeng-852a9dfca6bc"><span class="s4">PrimeNG.</span></a> I had the chose of building my own drop-down or the designer has to accept whatever they gave him. I made the UI make what he wanted and I made the drop-down zero capacity and then...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Host: When you click on what you see you are clicking on the...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Host: Does that make sense? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:35 – Guest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">33:50 – Host. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:25 – Brian: That is interesting; remember when...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">34:58 – Host: We will send this episode to Jeremy – come on Jeremy! Any last ideas? Let’s move onto picks!</span></p>
