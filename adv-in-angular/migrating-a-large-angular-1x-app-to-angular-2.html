<h2>Migrating a Large Angular 1.x App to Angular 2+</h2>
<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long do you wait to load regular Angular? Today's episode features<strong> Migrating a Large Angular 1.x App to Angular 2+</strong> with Ciro Nunes. Ciro is a frontend engineer at CrossEngage. He appeared on <a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/089-aia-angular-cli-with-ciro-nunes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode 89</a>, where he talked about Angular CLI. Now, he shares how they migrated an app and the challenges they faced. Tune in! </span>
<h2>Facing the Challenge</h2>
Ciro was initially scared when he first looked at the application. It had on a complicated structure, and was not easy to set up. But as new things in Angular came, he and his colleagues decided to start the migration.

They did not have a well-defined strategy at first. Now, they make sure they upgrade all necessary page components into Angular at the same time.
<h2>Background Info about the App</h2>
The app had 6 screens with more than 2,000 modules. Their target users are business people. It's only a web application, and is not even responsive.

There are still more features that they want to implement in the app. That is why they still keep on working on it. The good thing about it is they can already ship the components from Angular 4.
<h2>Start from the Easy</h2>
For that, they use Angular upgrades. They thought it nice to start from reusable components. However, they started having duplicated codes in the process.

It made the app harder to maintain. So, they decided to start migrating the easiest page first, and avoid the big screens. That gives them the performance boost they need.
