<h2>Angular and Electron with Ryan Chenkie</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On today's episode, Adventures in Angular features <strong>Angular and Electron with Ryan Chenkie</strong>. Ryan is a product owner, blogger, and JavaScript trainer. His interests in working on Angular with other technologies led him to using it on desktop apps with Electron. Tune in!   </span>
<h2>Working with Angular and Electron</h2>
It started with Ryan's interest in working on Angular with other technologies. He once dabbled with Ionic, but eventually changed to Electron. He thought it would be a good try.

That inspired him to write a blog about it. He focused on marketing content, but also explored how Angular and Electron can be brought together.
<h2>Difference with Angular</h2>
According to Ryan, you can layer up an Electron app with Vanilla on the fronted. It's easy to set. One example is setting up a JavaScript app while working with a browser.

Things are a bit different with Angular. You need to arrange the CLI projects to make it run on Electron. There are a couple of arrangements, but it does not require a lot of effort.
<h2>The Electron Platform</h2>
By definition, Electron is a platform to build cross platform desktop application. With it, you can build and distribute for Mac, Windows, and Linux. What's nice is you can do all using the web technologies you already know.

In the end, you build an application that runs a browser. But, you can still do things with native OS.
