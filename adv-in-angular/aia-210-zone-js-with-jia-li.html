<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Show Topics:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:20 – What are zones?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:25 – Jia: It is a library developed 4 years ago. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:45 – Panelist: Execution context? What is this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">1:50 – Jia answers this question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:42 – I know it’s big in Angular because it kind of takes care of itself. What are the new things you have done in zones and let’s talk about that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:01 – Jia: I started contributing 2 years ago. About 1 year ago I was using Angular. I would like to talk about different</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:35 – Where are zones used in Angular – lots of people don’t know where it is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">3:48 – Jia: For four parts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:23 – What is this framework that you are talking about? Check-out the links for this framework.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">6:42 – Panelists chime-in with their comments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">7:29 – Jia: It is a standalone package in Zone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">8:27 – Going back to John’s question. I only ran into it a few times – one time in one of my classes I made a new behavior subject. That subject got created before the zone. Anything I did outside of Angular zone, didn’t know what was going on. Once I stuck the behavior subject in one of the classes everything got taken care of. You kind of monkey patch...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">what else gets monkey patched by zones?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">9:28 – Jia answers the question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">10:54 – Monkey-patch is a term that we use in this industry. What is it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">11:05 – Jia answers this question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Jia: Monkey patch basically is overriding the procedure for the API. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:05 – What are some of the new things you are doing? I know you’ve done some new things and what’s new with Zones?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">14:28 – Lia: It’s all about the performance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">16:55 – Panelist: I didn’t know all about these hooks – so that’s cool! I knew about handling errors, but I didn’t know there are different ways to work with the tasks. I am curious what kind of interesting things have you done with Zones as an Angular developer? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">17:38 – Lia answers the questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:15 – Debugging and tests are good for Zones. But it sounds like you are saying that Zones is not good for...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">19:50 – Lia answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:35 – Panelist: Sounds like Zones is doing what you need out of the box for...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">20:51 – Panelist: You improved some of the performance? Zones doesn’t have that much of a footprint and is pretty lightweight. How much did you better the performance? 20-30%? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">2:25 – Jia – I think the library is faster. There is a lot of garbage collection. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">It’s not that much.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">22:47 – <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/521063736/codebadgeorg/faqs"><span class="s2">Advertisement – Code Badges!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:38 – Panelist: So it will help with garbage collection. That is good to know. Cool to know that you can optimize such a small library with...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">23:48 – Jia comments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:09 – Panelist: Gottcha. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">26:16 – Jia continues this topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Jia: A lot of new things are happening with the testing in the Zone. There are a lot of new features in the syntax. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:35 – That is a nice feature to add back in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">27:43 – Jia continues the talk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">28:55 – Panelist: There are a lot of tests in this Repo. Do Zones generally work out of the box or do you have to add support for different things? What are the criteria to add support to? Blue Birds added to the list somehow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">29:32 – Jia answers this question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:03 – Panelist: Can the GIST team add support or only can the Zone team add it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">30:37 – Jia: Other teams can add support to their libraries. It’s public. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:10 – Panelist: This is over my head, but is there a plan to get the documents going? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:32 – Jia adds a comment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">31:41 – Panelist: Google this: What the heck is zones? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">An opposite side of the question: What would happen to Angular if you remove Zones.js? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">32:10 – Jia answers this question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">332:37 – Zones is effectively how it works sweetly in Angular. It’s not totally true but if you remove Zones.js – which I see some people doing – why would someone do this? Is it heavy is it...?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">33:20 – Jia answers the question. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Jia: It’s not good for the Angular element. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:29 – Panelist: It is an island of Angular. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">34:54 – Jia continues this conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:10 – Panelist: That’s interesting – good to know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">35:18 – Jia: Back to the new features.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">38:22 – Jia mentions another feature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">39:43 – JavaScript something haunts you – then you are now a real developer!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:03 – Jia: Yes, exactly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">40:10 – Panelist: I am going to put some things in the links that the listeners can access. (<a href="https://angular.io/api/core/NgZone"><span class="s4">NG Zone</span></a></span><span class="s2">)</span></p>
